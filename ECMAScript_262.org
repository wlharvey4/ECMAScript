* ECMAScript Description
#+cindex:Eich, Brendan
#+cindex:specification, ECMAScript
#+cindex:ECMAScript specification
The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting
language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape.

#+cindex:ECMA-262
#+cindex:ISO/IEC 16262
#+cindex:Spikdermonkey
ECMAScript is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA
International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262.  It was created to standardize
JavaScript (``Spidermonkey''), so as to foster multiple independent
implementations.  Other implementations include
  #+cindex:JScript
- JScript (Microsoft)
  #+cindex:ActionScript
- ActionScript (Macromedia Inc.; Adobe)


{{{heading(Built-In Types)}}}

#+cindex:object-based language
#+cindex:object definition
#+cindex:properties
#+cindex:attributes
#+cindex:primitive values
#+cindex:built-in types
ECMAScript is *object-based*: basic language and host facilities are provided
by /objects/, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects.
An ECMAScript *object* is a collection of /properties/ each with zero or more
/attributes/ that determine how each property can be used.  *Properties* are
containers that hold other /objects/, /primitive values/, or /functions/.  A
*primitive value* is a member of one of the following built-in types:
- Undefined
- Null
- Boolean
- Number
- String


#+cindex:Object type
An *object* is a member of the remaining built-in type
- Object


#+cindex:function
#+cindex:callable object, function
#+cindex:object, callable, function
#+cindex:method
And a *function* is a /callable object/.  A *method* is a function that is
associated with an object via a property.

{{{heading(Built-in Objects)}}}

#+cindex:built-in objects
ECMAScript defines a collection of *built-in objects* that round out the
definition of ECMAScript entities.  These built-in objects include:
- the global object
- the Object object
- the Function object
- the Array object
- the String object
- the Boolean object
- the Number object
- the Math object
- the Date object
- the RegExp object
- the JSON object
- the Error objects
  - EvalError
  - RangeError
  - ReferenceError
  - SyntaxError
  - TypeError
  - URIError


{{{heading(Built-In Operators)}}}

#+cindex:built-in operators
ECMAScript also defines a set of *built-in operators*.  ECMAScript operators
include:
- unary operators
- multiplicative operators
- additive operators
- bitwise shift operators
- relational operators
- equality operators
- binary bitwise operators
- binary logical operators
- assignment operators
- comma operator


{{{heading(ECMAScript Syntax)}}}

#+cindex:syntax
*ECMAScript syntax* intentionally resembles Java syntax.  ECMAScript syntax is
relaxed to enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language.

** ECMAScript History

   - 1993 ::
     - NCSA’s *Mosaic* was the first widely popular web browser.

   - 1994 ::
     - a company called *Netscape* was founded to exploit the potential of the
       nascent World Wide Web.
     - Netscape created the proprietary web browser *Netscape Navigator*,
     - Many of the original Mosaic authors went on to work on Navigator, but
       the two intentionally shared no code.
     - Netscape quickly realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic.

   - 1995 ::
     - Netscape hired *Brendan Eich* with the promise of letting him implement
       Scheme (a Lisp dialect) in the browser.
     - Before he could get started, Netscape collaborated with hardware and
       software company *Sun* (since bought by Oracle) to include its more
       static programming language, *Java*, in Navigator.
     - As a consequence, a hotly debated question at Netscape was why the Web
       needed two programming languages: Java and a scripting language.
     - Netscape management decided that a scripting language had to have a
       syntax similar to Java’s.
     - That ruled out adopting existing languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or
       Scheme.
     - To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, Netscape
       needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days.
     - JavaScript’s first code name was *"Mocha"*.
     - Netscape marketing later changed it to *"LiveScript"*, for trademark
       reasons and because the names of several products already had the prefix
       “Live.”
     - In late November 1995, *Navigator 2.0B3* came out and included the
       prototype, which continued its early existence without major changes.
     - In early December 1995, Java’s momentum had grown and the language was
       renamed again, to its final name, *JavaScript*.

   - 1996 ::
     - *Microsoft* implemented the same language, under the different
       name *JScript*, in Internet Explorer 3.0
     - Partially to keep Microsoft in check, Netscape decided to standardize
       JavaScript and asked the standards organization *Ecma International* to
       host the standard.
     - Work on a specification called *ECMA-262* started.
     - Because Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark on the term JavaScript, it
       couldn’t be the official name of the language to be standardized. Hence,
       *ECMAScript* was chosen, derived from JavaScript and Ecma.
     - However, that name is used only to refer to versions of the language
       (where one refers to the specification).  Everyone still calls the
       language *JavaScript*.
       #+cindex:TC39
     - *ECMA-262* is managed and evolved by Ecma’s *Technical Committee 39
       (TC39)*.  [[https://tc39.es][TC39]]

   - 1997 ::
     - ECMAScript 1 *First Edition*
     - *Dynamic HTML*: allows you to dynamically change the content and
       appearance of a web page, achieved by manipulating the Document Object
       Model (DOM) of the page, a tree-shaped data structure.  Things that can
       be done include: changing content, changing style, and showing and
       hiding elements.  First in Internet Explorer 4 and in Netscape
       Navigator 4.

   - 1998 ::
     - ECMAScript 2 --- Editorial changes to align ECMA-262 with the standard
       ISO/IEC 16262

   - 1999 ::
     - ECMAScript 3 --- ~do-while~, regular expressions, new string methods
       (~concat~, ~match~, ~replace~, ~slice~, ~split~ with a regular
       expression, etc.), exception handling, and more
     - *XMLHttpRequest*: lets a client-side script send an HTTP or HTTPS
       request to a server and get back data, usually in a text format (XML,
       HTML, JSON).  Introduced in Internet Explorer 5.

   - 2001 ::
     - *JSON*: a JavaScript-based data exchange format.  *Douglas Crockford*
       named and documented JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), whose main idea
       is to use JavaScript syntax to store data in text format.  JSON uses
       JavaScript literals for objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and booleans
       to represent structured data.

   - 2004 ::
     - *Dojo Toolkit*: a framework for programming JavaScript in the large.
       The Dojo Toolkit facilitates programming in the large by providing the
       necessary infrastructure: an inheritance library, a module system, an
       API for desktop-style graphical widgets, and more.
       - https://dojotoolkit.org
       - https://github.com/dojo/dojo

   - 2005 ::
     - *AJAX* (/Asynchronous JavaScript and XML/): browser-based desktop-class
       applications.  Ajax is a collection of technologies that brings a level
       of interactivity to web pages that rivals that of desktop applications.
       The two cornerstones of Ajax are:
       1. loading content asynchronously in the background (via
          ~XMLHttpRequest~); and
       2. dynamically updating the current page with the results (via /dynamic
          HTML/).

       [[https://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/][Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications]] February 18, 2005 | By Jesse
       James Garrett

       Ajax marked the mainstream breakthrough of JavaScript and dynamic web
       applications.  It is interesting to note how long that took—at that
       point, the Ajax ingredients had been available for years.  Since the
       inception of Ajax, other data formats have become popular (JSON instead
       of XML), other protocols are used (e.g., Web Sockets in addition to
       HTTP), and bidirectional communication is possible. But the basic
       techniques are still the same.

       The term Ajax is used much less these days and has mostly been replaced
       by the more comprehensive terms *HTML5* and *Web Platform* (which both
       mean /JavaScript plus browser APIs/).

     - *Apache CouchDB*: a JavaScript-centric database.  Roughly, CouchDB is a
       JSON database: you feed it JSON objects, without the need to specify a
       schema in advance. Additionally, you can define views and indexes via
       JavaScript functions that perform map/reduce operations. Hence, CouchDB
       is a very good fit for JavaScript because you can work directly with
       native data.  Compared to a /relational database/, there is no
       mapping-related impedance mismatch.  Compared to an /object database/,
       you avoid many complications because only data is stored, not behavior.

       CouchDB is just one of several similar *NoSQL databases*.  Most of them
       have excellent JavaScript support.

       - http://couchdb.apache.org
       - https://github.com/apache/couchdb

   - 2006 ::
     - *jQuery*: helping with DOM manipulation.  The browser DOM is one of the
       most painful parts of client-side web development.  jQuery made DOM
       manipulation fun by abstracting over browser differences and by
       providing a powerful fluent-style API for querying and modifying the
       DOM.

   - 2007 ::
     - *WebKit*: aking the mobile web mainstream.  Based on prior work by KDE,
       WebKit is an /HTML engine/ that was introduced by Apple in 2003.  It was
       open-sourced in 2005.  With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, the
       mobile Web suddenly became mainstream and had little to no limitations
       compared to the nonmobile Web.

   - 2008 ::
     - ECMAScript 4 (Abandoned)

       ECMAScript 4 was developed as the next version of JavaScript, with a
       prototype written in ML.  However, TC39 could not agree on its feature
       set.  To prevent an impasse, the committee met at the end of July 2008
       and came to an accord, summarized in four points:

       1. Develop an incremental update of ECMAScript 3 (which became
          *ECMAScript 5*).

       2. Develop a major new version that does less than ECMAScript 4, but
          much more than the incremental update of ECMAScript 3. The code name
          for the new version is *Harmony*, due to the nature of the meeting in
          which it was conceived.  Harmony will be split into ECMAScript 6 and
          ECMAScript 7.

       3. Features from ECMAScript 4 that would be *dropped* included
          /packages/, /namespaces/, and /early binding/.

       4. Other ideas were to be developed in consensus with all of TC39.

       Thus, the ECMAScript 4 developers agreed to make Harmony less radical
       than ECMAScript 4, and the rest of TC39 agreed to keep moving things
       forward.

   - V8 :: proving JavaScript can be fast.  When Google introduced its Chrome
     web browser, one of its highlights was a fast JavaScript engine called V8.
     It changed the perception of JavaScript as being slow and led to a speed
     race with other browser vendors from which we are still profiting.  V8 is
     open source and can be used as a standalone component whenever you need a
     fast embedded language that is widely known.

   - 2009 ::
     - ECMAScript 5 --- Adds a strict mode, getters and setters, new array
       methods, support for JSON, and more

     - *Node.js*: implementing JavaScript on the server.  Created by Ryan Dahl,
       Node.js lets you implement servers that perform well under load.  To do
       so, it uses /event-driven/, /nonblocking I/O/ and /JavaScript/ (via V8).
       JavaScript was chosen for some of the following reasons:
       - “Because it’s bare and does not come with I/O APIs.” [Node.js can thus
         introduce its own nonblocking APIs.]
       - “Web developers use it already.” [JavaScript is a widely known
         language, especially in a web context.]
       - “DOM API is event-based.  Everyone is already used to running without
         threads and on an event loop.” [Developers are used to an asynchronous
         coding style.]

       The appeal of Node.js for JavaScript programmers goes beyond being able
       to program in a familiar language; you get to use the same language on
       both client and server.  That means you can share more code (e.g., for
       validating data) and use techniques such as isomorphic
       JavaScript. Isomorphic JavaScript is about assembling web pages on
       either client or server, with numerous benefits: pages can be rendered
       on the server for faster initial display, SEO, and running on browsers
       that either don’t support JavaScript or a version that is too old. But
       they can also be updated on the client, resulting in a more responsive
       user interface.

     - *PhoneGap*: writing native apps in HTML5.  The initial mission of
       PhoneGap was to make it possible to implement native mobile apps via
       HTML5. Since then, support has expanded to nonmobile operating
       systems. Currently supported platforms include Android, Bada,
       BlackBerry, Firefox OS, iOS, Mac OS X, Tizen, Ubuntu, Windows (desktop),
       and Windows Phone.

     - *Chrome OS*: making the browser the operating system.  With Chrome OS,
       the web platform is the native platform. This approach has several
       advantages:
       - It is much easier to create an operating system, because all of the
         user interface technology is already there.
       - Many developers already (mostly) know how to write apps for the
         operating system.
       - Managing apps is simple. That helps public installations such as
         Internet cafes and schools.

   - 2011 ::
     - ECMAScript 5.1 --- Editorial changes to align ECMA-262 with the third
       edition of the international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011

     - *Windows 8*: first-class HTML5 apps.  Microsoft's Windows 8 has
       extensive integration with HTML5.  HTML5 applications are first-class
       citizens in Windows 8, on par with those implemented via incumbent
       technologies such as .NET and C++.

   - 2015 ::
     - ECMAScript 6
     - renamed to *ECMAScript 2015*
     - and *ES2015*
     - many new features added

   - 2016 ::
     - *ECMAScript 2016* (7th Edition)
     - exponentiation operator; ~Array.prototype.includes()~

   - 2017 ::
     - *ECMAScript 2017* (8th Edition)
     - concurrency; atomics; ~async/await~

   - 2018 ::
     - *ECMAScript 2018* (9th Edition)
     - asynchronous iteration and generators; new RegExp features; rest/spread
       parameters

** CommonJS

   The dominant incarnation of this standard is *Node.js modules* (Node.js
   modules have a few features that go beyond CJS).

   - http://www.commonjs.org
   - http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS [fn:4]

   JavaScript is a powerful object oriented language with some of the fastest
   dynamic language interpreters around.  The official JavaScript specification
   defines APIs for some objects that are useful for building browser-based
   applications.  *However, the spec does not define a standard library that is
   useful for building a broader range of applications*.

   The CommonJS API will fill that gap by *defining APIs that handle many
   common application needs*, ultimately providing a standard library as rich
   as those of Python, Ruby and Java.  The intention is that an application
   developer will be able to write an application using the CommonJS APIs and
   then run that application across different JavaScript interpreters and host
   environments.

   With CommonJS-compliant systems, you can use JavaScript to write:

   - Server-side JavaScript applications
   - Command line tools
   - Desktop GUI-based applications
   - Hybrid applications (Titanium, Adobe AIR)

#+cindex:Netscape JavaScript
#+cindex:Microsoft JScript
This ECMA Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well
known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).

#+cindex:Eich, Brendan
#+cindex:Netscape Navigator 2.0 browser
#+cindex:Internet Explorer 3.0
The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in
that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser.  It has appeared in all subsequent
browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with
Internet Explorer 3.0.

#+cindex:ECMA General Assembly
#+cindex:first edition 1997
#+cindex:ECMA Standard, first edition
The development of this Standard started in November 1996.  The first edition of
this ECMA Standard was adopted by the ECMA General Assembly of June 1997.

#+cindex:ISO/IEC JTC 1
#+cindex:ISO/IEC 16262 international standard
That ECMA Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the
fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in
April 1998.

#+cindex:second edition ECMA-262, 1998
The ECMA General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262
to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262.  Changes between the first and the
second edition are editorial in nature.

#+cindex:third edition ECMA-262, 1999
The current document defines the third edition of the Standard and includes:
- powerful regular expressions,
- better string handling,
- new control statements,
- try/catch exception handling,
- tighter definition of errors,
- formatting for numeric output and
- minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities
  and future language growth.


Work on the language is not complete. The technical committee is working on
significant enhancements, including mechanisms for scripts to be created and
used across the Internet, and tighter coordination with other standards bodies
such as groups within the World Wide Web Consortium and the Wireless
Application Protocol Forum.

** Edition 4

   Abandoned.

** Edition 5

   December 2009.  [[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262%25205th%2520edition%2520December%25202009.pdf][5th Edition]] PDF

   ECMAScript 5 is fully supported in all /modern/ browsers.

   - [[http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/][ES5 compatibility table]]
   - [[https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim][es5-shim]]

   Codifies de facto interpretations of the language specification that have
   become common among browser implementations and adds support for new
   features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition.

   - strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security ::

        'use strict' directive defines that the JavaScript code should be
        executed in "strict mode".

        ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The
        strict variant of the language excludes some specific syntactic and
        semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the
        detailed semantics of some features.  The strict variant also specifies
        additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error
        exceptions in situations that are not specified as errors by the
        non-strict form of the language.

        Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics
        of ECMAScript is explicitly made at the level of individual ECMAScript
        code units.  Because strict mode is selected at the level of a
        syntactic code unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that have
        local effect within such a code unit.

   - ambiguities clarified ::

   - accessor properties---getters and setters ::

        Getters and setters allow the programnmer to implement the getting and
        setting of a property via methods.

   - syntactic changes ::

        ECMAScript 5 includes the following syntactic changes:

     + Reserved words as property keys; the programmer can use reserved words
       (such as ~new~ and ~function~) after the dot operator and as unquoted
       property keys in object literals.

     + Legal trailing commas

     + Multiline string literals using a trailing backslash (=/=)

   - New Functionality in the Standard Library ::

     + *Metaprogramming* (reflective creation and inspection of objects)

       - Getting and setting prototypes

         - ~Object.create()~

         - ~Object.getPrototypeOf()~

       - Managing property attributes via property descriptors (program control

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   ECMAScript 5 is a nice and decent programming language, of course. But
   because of its history, it has some nasty aspects which ECMAScript 6 finally
   resolves.... ECMAScript 6's language design is cleaner than ECMAScript 5,
   its syntax increases the expressiveness of your code, it decreases the
   necessary boilerplate code (e.g. function vs. arrow syntax) and it
   especially let you get rid of some very nasty but required hacks and
   workarounds from the ECMAScript 5 era (e.g. ~var self = this~).

{{{heading(The ~with~ Statement is Deprecated)}}}

#+cindex:strict mode, @code{with} statement
*DEPRECATED*: Using ~with~ is not recommended, and is forbidden in ECMAScript 5
strict mode.

The recommended alternative is to assign the object whose properties you want
to access to a temporary variable.

{{{heading(About the ~with~ Statement)}}}

#+cindex:scope chain, extends
The ~with~ statement extends the scope chain for a statement.

- expression :: Adds the given expression to the scope chain used when
                evaluating the statement. The parentheses around the expression
                are required.

- statement :: Any statement. To execute multiple statements, use a =block=
               statement =({ ... })= to group those statements.


{{{heading(Description of the ~with~ Statement)}}}

{{{subheading(Scope Chain of the Execution Context)}}}

#+cindex:scope chain
#+cindex:execution context
JavaScript looks up an unqualified name by searching a /scope chain/ associated
with the execution context of the script or function containing that
unqualified name.

The ~with~ statement adds the given object to the head of this scope chain
during the evaluation of its statement body.

#+cindex:@code{ReferenceError}
If an unqualified name used in the body matches a property in the scope chain,
then the name is bound to the property and the object containing the
property.  Otherwise a ~ReferenceError~ is thrown.

{{{heading(A ~with~ Statement Example)}}}

The following ~with~ statement specifies that the Math object is the default
object. The statements following the with statement refer to the PI property
and the cos and sin methods, without specifying an object. JavaScript assumes
the Math object for these references.

#+caption:An Example of the ~with~ Statement
#+name:with-statement-example
#+begin_src js -n
var a, x, y;
var r = 10;

with (Math) {
  a = PI * r * r;
  x = r * cos(PI);
  y = r * sin(PI / 2);
}
#+end_src

#+cindex:scope chain
#+cindex:computed object
#+cindex:execution context
The ~with~ statement adds a /computed object/ to the front of the scope chain
of the current execution context, then executes a statement with this augmented
scope chain, then restores the scope chain.

{{{heading(Semantics)}}}

1. Evaluate =Expression=

2. Call ~GetValue(Result(1))~

3. Call ~ToObject(Result(2))~

4. Add ~Result(3)~ to the front of the scope chain

   #+cindex:scope chain, augmented
5. Evaluate ~Statement~ using the augmented scope chain from step 4

6.  Let ~C~ be ~Result(5~).  If an exception was thrown in step 5, let ~C~ be
   (throw, ~V~, empty), where ~V~ is the exception.  (Execution now proceeds as
   if no exception were thrown.)

7. Remove ~Result(3)~ from the front of the scope chain

8. Return ~C~


{{{heading(Intended Use of the ~with~ Statement)}}}

The ~with~ statement's intended use is to avoid redundancy when accessing an
object several times.  The following is an example of code with redundancies:

#+begin_src js
foo.bar.baz.bla =123;
foo.bar.baz.yadda = 'abc';
#+end_src

~with~ makes this shorter:

#+begin_src js
  with (foo.bar.baz) { 
      bla = 123;
      yadda = 'abc';
  }
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Techniques for avoiding the ~with~ statement)}}}

Use a temporary variable with a short name, or an IIFE:

#+begin_src js
  // Don't do this:
  with (foo.bar.baz) {
  console.log('Hello '+first+' '+last);

  // Do this instead:
  var b = foo.bar.baz;
  console.log('Hello '+b.first+' '+b.last);

  // Or use an IIFE to avoid exposing ~b~ to the current scope
  (function () {
      var b = foo.bar.baz;
      console.log('Hello '+b.first+' '+b.last);
  }());

  // Or make the object a parameter of the IIFE:
  (function (b) {
      console.log('Hello '+b.first+' '+b.last);
  }(foo.bar.baz));
#+end_src


{{{heading(Performance Issues)}}}

- pro :: The ~with~ statement can help reduce file size by reducing the need to
         repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty.  The
         scope chain change required by ~with~ is not computationally
         expensive.  Use of ~with~ will relieve the interpreter of parsing
         repeated object references.  *In many cases this benefit can be
         achieved by using a temporary variable to store a reference to the
         desired object*.

- con :: The ~with~ statement forces the specified object to be searched first
         for all name lookups.  Therefore all identifiers that aren't members
         of the specified object will be found more slowly in a ~with~ block.
         Where performance is important, ~with~ should only be used to
         encompass code blocks that access members of the specified object.

- con :: The ~with~ statement makes it hard for a human reader or JavaScript
         compiler to decide whether an unqualified name will be found along the
         scope chain, and if so, in which object.  So given this example:

         #+attr_texinfo: :author Brendan Eich
         #+begin_quote
         ``[W]ith violates lexical scope, making program analysis (e.g. for
         security) hard to infeasible.''
         #+end_quote

         #+begin_src js -n
           function f(x, o) {
             with (o) {
               console.log(x);
             }
           }
         #+end_src

         #+cindex:activation object
         Only when ~f~ is called is ~x~ either found or not, and if found,
         either in ~o~ or (if no such property exists) in ~f~'s activation
         object, where ~x~ names the first formal argument.  If you forget to
         define ~x~ in the object you pass as the second argument, or if there's
         some similar bug or confusion, you won't get an error --- just
         unexpected results.

** Function Definition

** Program

** Native Objects

** Errors

** About This
*** this Keyword
When a function is created, a keyword called ~this~ is created (behind the
scenes), which links to the object in which the function operates.  ~this~ is
available to the scope of its function, yet is a reference to the object of
which that function is a property/method.  The keyword ~this~ looks and acts
like any other variable, except you can't modify it.  As opposed to arguments
and any parameters sent to the function, ~this~ is a keyword (not a property)
in the call/activation object.

#+begin_src js
var cody = {
    living:true,
    age:23,
    gender:'male',
    getGender:function() { return cody.gender; }
};

console.log(cody.getGender()); // logs 'male'
#+end_src

Notice how inside of the ~getGender~ function, we are accessing the gender
property using dot notation (e.g. ~cody.gender~) on the cody object itself.
This can be rewritten using ~this~ to access the =cody= object because ~this~
points to the =cody= object.

#+begin_src js
var cody = {
    living:true,
    age:23,
    gender:'male',
    getGender:function() { return this.gender; }
};

console.log(cody.getGender()); // logs 'male'
#+end_src

The ~this~ used in ~this.gender~ simply refers to the =cody= object on which
the function is operating.

{{{heading(The Value of this)}}}

#+cindex:@code{this} value
#+cindex:strict mode
The value of ~this~, passed to all functions, is based on the context in which
the function is called at runtime.  The value of ~this~ in nonmethod functions is
the global object unless strict mode is in effect, in which case the value will
be =undefined=.  The value of ~this~ when passed to a method will be a
reference to the object making the call.

The ~myObject~ object in the code below is given a property called =sayFoo=,
which points to the ~sayFoo~ function.  When the ~sayFoo~ function is called
from the global scope, this refers to the window object.  When it is called as
a method of ~myObject~, this refers to ~myObject~.

#+begin_src js -n
var foo = 'foo';
var myObject = {foo: 'I am myObject.foo'};

var sayFoo = function() {
    console.log(this['foo']);
};

// give myObject a sayFoo property and have it point to sayFoo function
myObject.sayFoo = sayFoo;

myObject.sayFoo(); // logs 'I am myObject.foo'

sayFoo(); // logs 'foo'
#+end_src

Clearly, the value of ~this~ is based on the context in which the function is
being called.  Consider that both ~myObject.sayFoo~ and ~sayFoo~ point to the
same function.  However, depending upon where (i.e. the context) ~sayFoo()~ is
called from, the value of ~this~ is different.

*** this in Nested Functions

#+cindex:ECMAScript 3
#+cindex:head object
#+cindex:nest functions and @code{this}
You might be wondering what happens to ~this~ when it is used inside of a
function that is contained inside of another function.  The bad news is in ECMA
3, ~this~ loses its way and refers to the head object (window object in
browsers), instead of the object within which the function is defined.

In the code below, ~this~ inside of ~func2~ and ~func3~ loses its way and
refers not to =myObject= but instead to the head object.

#+begin_src js -n
var myObject = {
    func1:function() {
        console.log(this); //logs myObject
        varfunc2=function() {
            console.log(this) //logs window, and will do so from this point on
            varfunc3=function() {
                console.log(this);//logs window, as it’s the head object
            }();
        }();
    }
};

myObject.func1();
#+end_src

#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
The good news is that this will be fixed in ECMAScript 5.  For now, you should
be aware of this predicament, especially when you start passing functions
around as values to other functions.

Consider the code below and what happens when passing an anonymous function to
~foo.func1~.  When the anonymous function is called inside of ~foo.func1~ (a
function inside of a function) the ~this~ value inside of the anonymous
function will be a reference to the head object.

#+begin_src js -n
var foo = {
    func1:function(bar){
        bar();//logs window, not foo
        console.log(this); // the this keyword here will be a reference to foo object
    }
}

foo.func1( function() { console.log(this) } );
#+end_src

#+cindex:scope chain and @code{this}
#+cindex:@code{that}
So that the ~this~ value does not get lost, you can simply use the scope chain
to keep a reference to ~this~ in the parent function.  The code below
demonstrates how, using a variable called ~that~, and leveraging its scope, we
can keep better track of function context.

#+begin_src js -n
var myObject = {
    myProperty: 'I can see the light',
    myMethod:function() {
        var that=this; // store a reference to this (i.e. myObject) in my Methodscope
        var helperFunction function() { //child function
            // logs 'I can see the light' via scope chain because that=this
            console.log(that.myProperty); // logs 'I can see the light'
            console.log(this); // logs window object, if we don't use "that"
        }();
    }
}

myObject.myMethod(); // invoke myMethod
#+end_src

The following is an example where we call ~forEach~ with a function to iterate
over an array.  Calling ~logHiToFriends~ produces an error:

#+begin_src js -n
var jane = {
    name: 'Jane',
    friends: [ 'Tarzan', 'Cheeta' ],
    logHiToFriends: function () {
        'use strict';
        this.friends.forEach(function (friend) {
            // `this` is undefined here
            console.log(this.name+' says hi to '+friend);
        });
    }
}

> jane.logHiToFriends()
TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
#+end_src

So while ~this~ is defined inside the ~logHiToFriends~ method, it is
=undefined= inside the ~forEach~ function.  In addition to the prevous method
of storing the ~this~ value inside a different variable, e.g., ~that~,
~forEach~ has a second parameter that allows you to provide a value for ~this~:

#+begin_src js -n
logHiToFriends: function () {
    'use strict';
    this.friends.forEach(function (friend) {
        console.log(this.name+' says hi to '+friend);
    }, this);
}
#+end_src

#+attr_texinfo: :options Array.prototype forEach ( callback( curValue [, index [, array]]) [, thisArg] );
#+begin_defmethod

The ~forEach()~ method calls a provided callback function once for each element
in an array in ascending order.  It is not invoked for index properties that
have been deleted or are uninitialized (sparse arrays).  The ~callback~ is
invoked with three arguments.  Unlike ~map()~ or ~reduce()~ it always returns
the value =undefined= and is not chainable.  The typical use case is to execute
side effects at the end of a chain.  ~forEach()~ does not mutate the array on
which it is called (although ~callback~, if invoked, may do so).

- {{{var(callback)}}} :: Function to execute on each element, taking three
     arguments:

  - {{{var(curValue)}}} :: The current element being processed in the array.

  - {{{var(index)}}} (optional) :: The index of the current element being
       processed in the array.

  - {{{var(array)}}} (optional) :: The array ~forEach()~ was called upon.

- {{{var(thisArg)}}} (optional) :: Value to use as ~this~ when executing
     callback.

- Return Value :: =undefined=


There is no way to stop or break a ~forEach()~ loop other than by throwing an
exception.  If you need such behavior, the ~forEach()~ method is the wrong
tool.  Early termination may be accomplished with:

- A simple ~for~ loop

- A ~for...of~ / ~for...~ in loops

- ~Array.prototype.every()~

- ~Array.prototype.some()~

- ~Array.prototype.find()~

- ~Array.prototype.findIndex()~


Array methods: ~every()~, ~some()~, ~find()~, and ~findIndex()~ test the array
elements with a predicate returning a truthy value to determine if further
iteration is required.
#+end_defmethod

*** Controlling this with call and apply
You can overwrite/control the value of ~this~ using ~apply()~ or ~call()~ to
define what object ~this~ points to when invoking a function.  By doing so, the
default way in which JavaScript determines the value of ~this~ is overridden.

Below, we create an object and a function.  We then invoke the function via
~call()~ so that the value of ~this~ inside the function uses =myObject= as its
context.  The statements inside the ~myFunction~ function will then populate
=myObject= with properties instead of populating the head object.  We have
altered the object to which ~this~ (inside of ~myFunction~) refers.

#+begin_src js -n

var myObject = {};

var myFunction = function(param1, param2) {
    //set via call() 'this' points to myObject when function is invoked
    this.foo=param1;
    this.bar=param2;
    console.log(this) // logs Object { foo='foo', bar='bar' }
};

myFunction.call(myObject, 'foo', 'bar'); // invoke function, set this value to myObject

console.log(myObject) // logs Object {foo = 'foo', bar = 'bar'}
#+end_src

In the example above, we are using ~call()~, but apply()~ could be used as
well.  The difference between the two is how the parameters for the function
are passed.  Using ~call()~, the parameters are just comma-separated values.
Using ~apply()~, the parameter values are passed inside of an array.

: myFunction.apply(myObject, ['foo', 'bar']); // invoke function, set this value

*** this and a Constructor Function
When a function is invoked with the ~new~ keyword, the value of ~this~ within
the function refers to the instance itself.  In the constructor function, we
can leverage the object via ~this~ before the object is actually created.

Below, we set up a =Person= constructor function that uses ~this~ to reference
an object being created.  When an instance of =Person= is created, ~this.name~
will reference the newly created object and place a property called =name= in
the new object with a value from the parameter (=name=) passed to the
constructor function.

#+begin_src js -n
var Person = function(name) {
    this.name=name || 'johndoe'; //this will refer to the instance created
}

var cody = new Person('Cody Lindley'); // create an instance, based on Person constructor

console.log(cody.name); // logs 'Cody Lindley'
#+end_src

~this~ refers to the "object that is to be" when the constructor function is
invoked using the ~new~ keyword.  Had we not used the ~new~ keyword, the value
of ~this~ would be the context in which Person is invoked---in this case the
head object (i.e., =window=).

When in strict mode, if a constructor function is called without the =new=
keyword, any attempt to set a property will raise a warning, since the ~this~
value will be =undefined=:

#+begin_src js
function Point(x, y) {
    'use strict';
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

> var pt = Point(3, 1);
TypeError: Cannot set property 'x' of undefined
#+end_src

Due to strict mode, you get a warning when you accidentally forget =new= and
call it as a function.  In sloppy mode, you don’t get a warning, and global
variables ~x~ and ~y~ are created.

*** this in a Prototype Method
When used in functions added to a constructorʼs prototype property, ~this~
refers to the instance on which the method is invoked.  The keyword ~this~ is
used to refer to instances when used inside of a method contained in the
prototype object.  If the instance does not contain the property, the prototype
lookup begins.

*** this and the Global Object
**** The Global Object
The global object is a predefined object that serves as a placeholder for the
global properties and functions of JavaScript.  All other predefined objects,
functions, and properties are accessible through the global object.

#+cindex:@code{this} keyword
#+cindex:global object, this
#+cindex:scope chain, top, global object
In top-level JavaScript code, you can refer to the global object with the
keyword ~this~.  It is rarely necessary to refer to the global object in this
way, however, because the global object serves as the top of the scope chain,
which means that unqualified variable and function names are looked up as
properties of the object.  When JavaScript code refers to the ~parseInt()~
function, for example, it is referring to the ~parseInt~ property of the global
object.

The fact that the global object is the top of the scope chain also means that
all variables declared in top-level JavaScript code become properties of the
global object.

**** Properties of the Global Object using this
#+cindex:global object properties, using @code{this}
In core JavaScript, none of the predefined properties of the global object are
enumerable, so you can list all implicitly and explicitly declared global
variables with a =for/in= loop like this:

#+begin_src js
var variables = ""
for(var name in this)
    variables += name + "\n";
#+end_src

*** this as a Primary Expression
#+cindex:expression
An /expression/ is a phrase of JavaScript that a JavaScript interpreter can
evaluate to produce a value.

- A constant embedded literally in your program is a very simple kind of
  expression.

- A variable name is also a simple expression that evaluates to whatever value
  has been assigned to that variable.

  #+pindex:expression, complex
- Complex expressions are built from simpler expressions.

  #+cindex:array access expression
  - An /array access expression/, for example, consists of one expression that
    evaluates to an array followed by an open square bracket, an expression
    that evaluates to an integer, and a close square bracket.  This new, more
    complex expression evaluates to the value stored at the specified index of
    the specified array.

    #+cindex:function invocation expression
  - Similarly, a /function invocation expression/ consists of one expression
    that evaluates to a function object and zero or more additional expressions
    that are used as the arguments to the function.


#+cindex:primary expression
The simplest expressions, known as /primary expressions/, are those that stand
alone---they do not include any simpler expressions.  Primary expressions in
JavaScript are:

- constant or literal values

  - Literals are constant values that are embedded directly in your program.

    - number literals

    - string literals

    - regular expression literal

- certain language keywords

  - Some of JavaScript’s reserved words are primary expressions:

    - ~true~

    - ~false~

    - ~null~

      #+cindex:@code{this} keyword
    - ~this~: Evaluates to the "current" object

      Unlike the other keywords, ~this~ is not a constant---it evaluates to
      different values in different places in the program.  The ~this~ keyword
      is used in object-oriented programming.  Within the body of a method,
      ~this~ evaluates to the object on which the method was invoked.

- variable references

*** this and Event Handlers
**** Event Handler Invocation
- event handler arguments
- event handler invocation context (~this~ value)
- invocation scope
- event handler return value

**** Event Handler Arguments
#+cindex:event object
Event handlers are normally invoked with an event object as their single
argument.  The properties of the event object provide details about the event.

**** Event Handler Context
#+cindex:event handler
An important thing to know about event handlers is that within the code of an
event handler, the ~this~ keyword refers to the document element that triggered
the event.

When you register an event handler by setting a property, it looks as if you
are defining a new method on the document element:

#+begin_src js
e.onclick = function() { /* handler code */ };
#+end_src

Event handlers are invoked as methods of the object on which they are defined.
That is, within the body of an event handler, the ~this~ keyword refers to the
event target.

#+cindex:@code{addEventListener()}
#+cindex:@code{attachEvent()}
Handlers are invoked with the target as their ~this~ value even when registered
using ~addEventListener()~.  This is not true for ~attachEvent()~: handlers
registered with ~attachEvent()~ are invoked as functions, and their ~this~
value is the global (Window) object.

You can work around this with code like this:

#+begin_src js
/*
,* Register the specified handler function to handle events of the specified
,* type on the specified target. Ensure that the handler will always be
,* invoked as a method of the target.
,*/
function addEvent(target, type, handler) {
    if (target.addEventListener)
        target.addEventListener(type, handler, false); 
    else
        target.attachEvent("on" + type, function(event) {
            // Invoke the handler as a method of target,
            // passing on the event object
            return handler.call(target, event);
        });
}
#+end_src

**** Event Handler Scope
Like all JavaScript functions, event handlers are lexically scoped.  They are
executed in the scope in which they are defined, not the scope from which they
are invoked, and they can access any local variables from that scope.

***** HTML Event Handlers
Event handlers registered as HTML attributes are a special case, however.  They
are converted into top-level functions that have access to global variables but
not to any local variables.  But, for historical reasons, they run with a
modified scope chain.  Event handlers defined by HTML attributes can use the
properties of the target object, the containing =<form>= object (if there is
one), and the =Document= object as if they are local variables.

HTML attributes are not natural places to include long strings of code, and
this modified scope chain allows helpful shortcuts.  You can use ~tagName~
instead of ~this.tagName~.  You can use ~getElementById~ instead of
~document.getElementById~.  And, for document elements that are inside a
=<form>=, you can refer to any other form element by ID, using =zipcode=, for
example, instead of =this.form.zipcode=.

#+cindex:shadow
On the other hand, the modified scope chain of HTML event handlers is a source
of pitfalls, since the properties of each of the objects in the chain shadow
any properties of the same name in the global object.  The =Document= object
defines a (rarely used) ~open()~ method, for example, so an HTML event handler
that wants to invoke the ~open()~ method of the =Window= object must explicitly
write ~window.open~ instead of ~open~.

There is a similar (but more pernicious) problem with forms, because the names
and IDs of form elements define properties on the containing form element.  So
if a form contains an element with the ID “location”, for example, all HTML
event handlers within that form must use ~window.location~ instead of
~location~ if they want to refer to the window’s =Location= object.

**** Handler Return Value
#+cindex:event handler return value
The return value of an event handler registered by setting an object property
or an HTML attribute is sometimes significant.  In general, a return value of
=false= tells the browser that it should not perform the default action
associated with the event.  The ~onclick~ handler of a =Submit= button in a
form, for example, can return =false= to prevent the browser from submitting
the form.  Similarly, an ~onkeypress~ handler on an input field can filter
keyboard input by returning =false= if the user types an inappropriate
character.

#+cindex:@code{addEventListener()}
#+cindex:@code{attachEvent()}
It is important to understand that event handler return values are significant
only for handlers registered as properties.  We’ll see below that event
handlers registered with ~addEventListener()~ or ~attachEvent()~ must instead
call the ~preventDefault()~ method or set the =returnValue= property of the
event object.

**** Form Event Handlers
#+cindex:@code{<form>} element
#+cindex:@code{form} property
#+cindex:Form property
#+cindex:document element, event handler
Since elements within a =<form>= element have a ~form~ property
that refers to the containing form, the event handlers of these elements can
always refer to the =Form= object as ~this.form~.  Going a step further, this
means that an event handler for one form element can refer to a sibling form
element named ~x~ as ~this.form.x~.

*** Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and "this"
- https://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/
- By Yehuda Katz
- 10 Aug 2011


{{{heading(Core Function Invocation Primitive)}}}

#+cindex:core function invocation primitive
Are the semantics of ~this~ in function invocations confusing?  If so, then a
lot of this confusion is cleared up by understanding the core function
invocation primitive, and then looking at all other ways of invoking a function
as sugar on top of that primitive.  This is exactly how the ECMAScript spec
thinks about it.

{{{subheading(A Function's ~call~ Method)}}}

This is the core function invocation primitive.  The call method is relatively
straight forward.

1. Make an argument list (~argList~) out of parameters 1 through the end

2. The first parameter is ~thisValue~

3. Invoke the function with ~this~ set to ~thisValue~ and the ~argList~ as its
   argument list


For example:

#+begin_src js
function hello(thing) {
  console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
}

hello.call("Yehuda", "world") //=> Yehuda says hello world
#+end_src

We invoked the ~hello~ method with this set to "Yehuda" and a single argument
"world".  This is the core primitive of JavaScript function invocation.  You can
think of all other function calls as desugaring to this primitive. (to
"desugar" is to take a convenient syntax and describe it in terms of a more
basic core primitive).

**** Simple Function Invocation

Invoking functions with ~call~ all the time would be pretty annoying.
JavaScript allows us to invoke functions directly using the =parens= syntax
(~hello("world"~).  When we do that, the invocation desugars:

#+begin_src js
function hello(thing) {
  console.log("Hello " + thing);
}

// this:
hello("world")

// desugars to:
hello.call(window, "world");
#+end_src

This behavior has changed in ECMAScript 5[fn:6] only when using strict mode:

#+begin_src js
// this:
hello("world")

// desugars to:
hello.call(undefined, "world");
#+end_src

The short version is: a function invocation like ~fn(...args)~ is the same as
~fn.call(window [ES5-strict: undefined], ...args)~.

Note that this is also true about functions declared inline:

: (function() {})()
is the same as
: function() {}).call(window [ES5-strict: undefined)

**** Member Functions
The next very common way to invoke a method is as a member of an object
(~person.hello()~).  In this case, the invocation desugars:

#+begin_src js -n
var person = {
  name: "Brendan Eich",
  hello: function(thing) {
    console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
  }
}

// this:
person.hello("world")

// desugars to this:
person.hello.call(person, "world");
#+end_src

Note that it doesn't matter how the ~hello~ method becomes attached to the object
in this form.  Remember that we previously defined ~hello~ as a standalone
function.  Let's see what happens if we attach is to the object dynamically:

#+begin_src js -n
function hello(thing) {
  console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
}

person = { name: "Brendan Eich" }
person.hello = hello;

person.hello("world") // still desugars to person.hello.call(person, "world")

hello("world") // "[object DOMWindow]world"
#+end_src

Notice that the function doesn't have a persistent notion of its 'this'.  It is
always set at call time based upon the way it was invoked by its caller.

**** Using ~function.prototype.bind~ Method
Because it can sometimes be convenient to have a reference to a function with a
persistent ~this~ value, people have historically used a simple closure trick to
convert a function into one with an unchanging ~this~:

#+begin_src js -n
var person = {
  name: "Brendan Eich",
  hello: function(thing) {
    console.log(this.name + " says hello " + thing);
  }
}

var boundHello = function(thing) { return person.hello.call(person, thing); }

boundHello("world");
#+end_src

#+cindex:@code{bind} function
We can make this trick general-purpose with a few tweaks:

#+begin_src js -n
var bind = function(func, thisValue) {
  return function() {
    return func.apply(thisValue, arguments);
  }
}

var boundHello = bind(person.hello, person);
boundHello("world") // "Brendan Eich says hello world"
#+end_src

#+cindex:@code{Function.prototype.apply} method
#+cindex:@code{apply} method
First, arguments is an Array-like object that represents all of the arguments
passed into a function.  Second, the ~apply~ method works exactly like the
~call~ primitive, except that it takes an Array-like object instead of listing
the arguments out one at a time.

Our ~bind~ method simply returns a new function.  When it is invoked, our new
function simply invokes the original function that was passed in, setting the
original value as ~this~.  It also passes through the arguments.

#+cindex:ES5
Because this was a somewhat common idiom, ES5 introduced a new method ~bind~ on
all Function objects that implements this behavior:

#+begin_src js -n
var boundHello = person.hello.bind(person);
boundHello("world") // "Brendan Eich says hello world"
#+end_src

This is most useful when you need a raw function to pass as a callback:

#+begin_src js -n
var person = {
  name: "Alex Russell",
  hello: function() { console.log(this.name + " says hello world"); }
}

$("#some-div").click(person.hello.bind(person));

// when the div is clicked, "Alex Russell says hello world" is printed
#+end_src
*** This and Function Invocation Context
#+cindex:invocation context
In addition to the arguments, each invocation has another value—the /invocation
context/---that is the value of the ~this~ keyword.  When a function is invoked
on or through an object, that object is the /invocation context/ or `this`
value for the function.

Note that ~this~ is a keyword, not a variable or property name.  JavaScript
syntax does not allow you to assign a value to ~this~.

**** Invoking Functions
#+cindex:invoke function
#+cindex:function, invoke
JavaScript functions can be invoked in four ways:

- as functions
- as methods
- as constructors
- indirectly through their ~call()~ and ~apply()~ methods

**** Function Invocation
#+cindex:invocation expression
#+cindex:function invocation expression
#+cindex:method invocation expression
Functions are invoked as functions or as methods with an /invocation
expression/.  An /invocation expression/ consists of a function expression that
evaluates to a function object followed by an open parenthesis, a
comma-separated list of zero or more argument expressions, and a close
parenthesis.  If the function expression is a /property-access expression/---if
the function is the property of an object or an element of an array---then it
is a /method invocation expression/.

#+cindex:argument expression
In an invocation, each argument expression (the ones between the parentheses)
is evaluated, and the resulting values become the arguments to the function.
These values are assigned to the parameters named in the function definition.
In the body of the function, a reference to a parameter evaluates to the
corresponding argument value.

For regular function invocation, the return value of the function becomes the
value of the invocation expression. If the function returns because the
interpreter reaches the end, the return value is undefined. If the function
returns because the interpreter exe- cutes a return, the return value is the
value of the expression that follows the return or undefined if the return
statement has no value.

#+cindex:invocation context
#+cindex:ECMAScript 3
#+cindex:ECMAScript 5 nonstrict mode, strict mode
#+cindex:@code{this} value
For function invocation in ECMAScript 3 and nonstrict ECMAScript 5, the
invocation context (the ~this~ value) is the global object.  In strict mode,
however, the invocation context is =undefined=.  Functions written to be
invoked as functions do not typically use the ~this~ keyword at all.  It can be
used, however, to determine whether strict mode is in effect:

#+begin_src js
// Define and invoke a function to determine if we're in strict mode.
// !undefined == true
// !window == false
var strict = (function() { return !this; }());
#+end_src

**** Method Invocation
#+cindex:method
A /method/ is nothing more than a JavaScript function that is stored in a
property of an object.

: o.m(x, y);

#+cindex:invocation expression
#+cindex:function expression
#+cindex:argument expression
#+cindex:property access expression
The code above is an /invocation expression/: it includes a /function
expression/ ~o.m~ and two /argument expressions/, ~x~ and ~y~.  The function
expression is itself a /property access expression/, and this means that the
function is invoked as a method rather than as a regular function.

Method invocations differ from function invocations in one important way,
however: the /invocation context/.  /Property access expressions/ consist of
two parts: an object (in this case ~o~) and a property name (~m~).  In a method
invocation expression like this, the object ~o~ becomes the /invocation
context/, and the function body can refer to that object by using the keyword
~this~.

{{{heading(Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm)}}}

Methods and the ~this~ keyword are central to the object-oriented programming
paradigm.  Any function that is used as a method is effectively passed an
implicit argument---the object through which it is invoked.  Typically, a
method performs some sort of operation on that object, and the
method-invocation syntax is an elegant way to express the fact that a function
is operating on an object.

***** Method Chaining

When methods return objects, you can use the return value of one method
invocation as part of a subsequent invocation.  This results in a series (or
“chain” or “cascade”) of method invocations as a single expression.  When you
write a method that does not have a return value of its own, consider having
the method return ~this~.  If you do this consistently throughout your API, you
will enable a style of programming known as /method chaining/ in which an
object can be named once and then multiple methods can be invoked on it:

: shape.setX(100).setY(100).setSize(50).setOutline("red").setFill("blue").draw();

Unlike variables, the ~this~ keyword does not have a scope, and nested
functions do not inherit the ~this~ value of their caller.  If a nested
function is invoked as a method, its ~this~ value is the object it was invoked
on.  If a nested function is invoked as a function then its ~this~ value will
be either the global object (non-strict mode) or =undefined= (strict mode).

It is a common mistake to assume that a nested function invoked as a function
can use ~this~ to obtain the invocation context of the outer function.  If you
want to access the ~this~ value of the outer function, you need to store that
value into a variable that is in scope for the inner function.  It is common to
use the variable ~self~ for this purpose.

#+begin_src js
var o = {				// An object o.
    m: function() {			// Method m of the object.
        var self = this;		// Save the this value in a variable.
        console.log(this === o);	// Prints "true": this is the object o.
        f();				// Now call the helper function f().

        function f() {			// A nested function f
            console.log(this === o);	// "false": this is global or undefined
            console.log(self === o);	// "true": self is the outer this value.
        }
    }
};
o.m();					// Invoke the method m on the object o.
#+end_src

**** Constructor Invocation
#+cindex:constructor invocation
#+cindex:@code{new} keyword
#+cindex:invocation context
If a function or method invocation is preceded by the keyword ~new~, then it is
a /constructor invocation/.  Constructor invocations differ from regular
function and method invocations in their handling of arguments, invocation
context, and return value.  If a constructor has no parameters, then JavaScript
constructor invocation syntax allows the argument list and parentheses to be
omitted entirely.

: var o = new Object;

#+cindex:prototype property
A constructor invocation creates a new, empty object that inherits from the
prototype property of the constructor.  Constructor functions are intended to
initialize objects and this newly created object is used as the invocation
context, so the constructor function can refer to it with the ~this~ keyword.

Constructor functions do not normally use the ~return~ keyword.  They typically
initialize the new object and then return implicitly when they reach the end of
their body.  If, however, a constructor explicitly used the ~return~ statement
to return an object, then that object becomes the value of the invocation
expression.  If the constructor uses ~return~ with no value, or if it returns a
primitive value, that return value is ignored and the new object is used as the
value of the invocation.

**** Indirect Invocation
#+cindex:@code{call()}
#+cindex:@code{apply()}
JavaScript functions are objects and like all JavaScript objects, they have
methods.  Two of these methods, ~call()~ and ~apply()~, invoke the function
indirectly.  Both methods allow you to explicitly specify the ~this~ value for
the invocation, which means you can invoke any function as a method of any
object, even if it is not actually a method of that object.  Both methods also
allow you to specify the arguments for the invocation.  The ~call()~ method
uses its own argument list as arguments to the function and the ~apply()~
method expects an array of values to be used as arguments.
*** The call() and apply() Methods
#+cindex:@code{call()}
#+cindex:@code{apply()}
#+cindex:invocation context
~call()~ and ~apply()~ allow you to indirectly invoke a function as if it were
a method of some other object.  The first argument to both ~call()~ and
~apply()~ is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument
is the /invocation context/ and becomes the value of the ~this~ keyword within
the body of the function.  To invoke the function ~f()~ as a method of the
object ~o~ (passing no arguments), you could use either ~call()~ or ~apply()~:

: f.call(o);
: f.apply(o);

Any arguments to ~call()~ after the first invocation context argument are the
values that are passed to the function that is invoked.  The ~apply()~ method
is like the ~call()~ method, except that the arguments to be passed to the
function are specified as an array:

: f.call(o, 1, 2);
: f.apply(o, [1,2]);

If a function is defined to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, the
~apply()~ method allows you to invoke that function on the contents of an array
of arbitrary length.  Note that ~apply()~ works with array-like objects as well
as true arrays.  In particular, you can invoke a function with the same
arguments as the current function by passing the arguments array directly to
~apply()~.

#+cindex:ECMAScript 3
#+cindex:non-strict mode
#+cindex:global object
In ECMAScript 3 and non-strict mode, a value of ~null~ or ~undefined~ is
replaced with the global object and a primitive value is replaced with the
corresponding wrapper object.

#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
#+cindex:scrict mode
In ECMAScript 5 strict mode the first argument to ~call()~ or ~apply()~ becomes
the value of ~this~, even if it is a primitive value or ~null~ or ~undefined~.

**** Monkey Patching
This ~trace()~ function is passed an object and a method name.  It replaces the
specified method with a new method that “wraps” additional functionality around
the original method.  This kind of dynamic alteration of existing methods is
sometimes called “monkey-patching.”

Replace the method named ~m~ of the object ~o~ with a version that logs
messages before and after invoking the original method.

#+begin_src js
function trace(o, m) {
    var original = o[m]; // Remember original method in the closure.
    o[m] = function() { // Now define the new method.
        console.log(new Date(), "Entering:", m); // Log message.
        var result = original.apply(this, arguments); // Invoke original.
        console.log(new Date(), "Exiting:", m); // Log message.
        return result; // Return result.
    };
}
#+end_src

*** The bind() Method
#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
#+cindex:@code{bind()}
The ~bind()~ method was added in ECMAScript 5, but it is easy to simulate in
ECMAScript 3.  The primary purpose of ~bind()~ is to bind a function to an
object.  When you invoke the ~bind()~ method on a function ~f~ and pass an
object ~o~, the method returns a new function.  Invoking the new function (as a
function) invokes the original function ~f~ as a method of ~o~.  Any arguments
you pass to the new function are passed to the original function.

#+begin_src js
function f(y) { return this.x + y; } // This function needs to be bound
var o = { x : 1 };                   // An object we'll bind t
var g = f.bind(o);                   // Calling g(x) invokes o.f(x)
g(2);                                // => 3
#+end_src

It is easy to accomplish this kind of binding with code like the following:

#+begin_src js
// Return a function that invokes f as a method of o, passing all its arguments.
function bind(f, o) {
    if (f.bind) return f.bind(o);   // Use the bind method, if there is one
    else return function() {        // Otherwise, bind it like this
        return f.apply(o, arguments);
    };
}
#+end_src

**** Partial Application
#+cindex:currying
#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
#+cindex:@code{bind()} method
#+cindex:partial application
The ECMAScript 5 ~bind()~ method does more than just bind a function to an
object.  It also performs /partial application/: any arguments you pass to
~bind()~ after the first are bound along with the ~this~ value.  Partial
application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes
called /currying/.

#+begin_src js
var sum = function(x,y) { return x + y }; // Return the sum of 2 args
// Create a new function like sum, but with the this value bound to null
// and the 1st argument bound to 1. This new function expects just one arg.
var succ = sum.bind(null, 1);
succ(2) // => 3: x is bound to 1, and we pass 2 for the y argument
#+end_src

#+begin_src js
function f(y,z) { return this.x + y + z }; // Another function that adds
var g = f.bind({x:1}, 2); // Bind this and y
g(3) // => 6: this.x is bound to 1, y is bound to 2 and z is 3
#+end_src

***** Partial Application in ECMAScript 3
We can bind the ~this~ value and perform partial application in ECMAScript 3.
The standard ~bind()~ method can be simulated with code like:[fn:7]

#+caption:A @code{Function.bind()} method for ECMAScript 3
#+name:partial-application-ECMAScript 3
#+begin_src js
if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
    Function.prototype.bind = function(o /*, args */) {
        // Save the this and arguments values into variables so we can
        // use them in the nested function below.
        var self = this, boundArgs = arguments;

        // The return value of the bind() method is a function 
        return function() {
            // Build up an argument list, starting with any args passed
            // to bind after the first one, and follow those with all args
            // passed to this function.
            var args = [], i;
            for(i = 1; i < boundArgs.length; i++) args.push(boundArgs[i]);
            for(i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) args.push(arguments[i]);

            // Now invoke self as a method of o, with those arguments
            return self.apply(o, args); 
        };
    };
}
#+end_src

#+cindex:closure
#+cindex:inner function
Notice that the function returned by this ~bind()~ method is a closure that
uses the variables ~self~ and ~boundArgs~ declared in the outer function, even
though that inner function has been returned from the outer function and is
invoked after the outer function has returned.

**** Advantages of ECMAScript 5 bind Method
The ~bind()~ method defined by ECMAScript 5 does have some features that cannot
be simulated with the ECMAScript 3 code shown above.

- First, the true ~bind()~ method returns a function object with its ~length~
  property properly set to the arity of the bound function minus the number of
  bound arguments (but not less than zero).

- Second, the ECMAScript 5 ~bind()~ method can be used for partial application
  of constructor functions.  If the function returned by ~bind()~ is used as a
  constructor, the ~this~ passed to ~bind()~ is ignored, and the original
  function is invoked as a constructor, with some arguments already bound.
  Functions returned by the ~bind()~ method do not have a prototype property
  (the prototype property of regular functions cannot be deleted) and objects
  created when these bound functions are used as constructors inherit from the
  prototype of the original, unbound constructor.  Also, a bound constructor
  works just like the unbound constructor for the purposes of the ~instanceof~
  operator.

* ECMAScript 5 Features
** this and Accessor Properties
#+cindex:accessor properties
#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
#+cindex:getter
#+cindex:setter
An object property is a name, a value, and a set of attributes.  In ECMAScript
5 (and in recent ECMAScript 3 versions of major browsers other than IE) the
value may be replaced by one or two methods, known as a /getter/ and a
/setter/.  Properties defined by /getters/ and /setters/ are sometimes known as
/accessor properties/ to distinguish them from /data properties/ that have a
simple value.

#+cindex:getter method
- When a program queries the value of an accessor property, JavaScript invokes
  the getter method (passing no arguments). The return value of this method
  becomes the value of the property access expression.

  #+cindex:setter method
- When a program sets the value of an accessor property, JavaScript invokes the
  setter method, passing the value of the right-hand side of the assignment.
  This method is responsible for “setting,” in some sense, the property value.
  The return value of the setter method is ignored.

  #+cindex:get
  #+cindex:set
- Accessor properties are defined as one or two functions whose name is the
  same as the property name, and with the =function= keyword replaced with
  =get= and/or =set=.


#+cindex:2D Cartesian point
#+cindex:Cartesian point
As an example, consider the following object that represents a 2D Cartesian
point.  It has ordinary data properties to represent the X and Y coordinates of
the point, and it has accessor properties for the equivalent polar coordinates
of the point:

#+begin_src js -n
var p = {
    // x and y are regular read-write data properties.
    x: 1.0,
    y: 1.0,

    // r is a read-write accessor property with getter and setter. // Don't forget to put a comma after accessor methods.
    get r() { return Math.sqrt(this.x*this.x + this.y*this.y); },

    set r(newvalue) {
        var oldvalue = Math.sqrt(this.x*this.x + this.y*this.y);
        var ratio = newvalue/oldvalue;
        this.x *= ratio;
        this.y *= ratio;
    },

    // theta is a read-only accessor property with getter only.
    get theta() {
        return Math.atan2(this.y, this.x);
    }
};
#+end_src

#+cindex:@code{this} keyword, accessor property
Note the use of the keyword ~this~ in the getters and setter above.  JavaScript
invokes these functions as methods of the object on which they are defined,
which means that within the body of the function ~this~ refers to the =point=
object.  So the getter method for the =r= property can refer to the ~x~ and ~y~
properties as ~this.x~ and ~this.y~.

** Promises
#+cindex:promises
First class representation of a value that may be made asynchronously and be
available in the future.

Promises can be vaguely defined as “a proxy for a value that will eventually
become available.”

*** Traditional Callback Method

#+cindex:callback
Traditionally JavaScript relied on /callbacks/ instead of /promises and
chaining/.  If the ~fetch~ function asked for a /callback/, you’d have to add
one that would then get executed whenever the fetch operation ended.

#+cindex:asynchronous code flow
#+cindex:best practice
Typical asynchronous code flow conventions in Node.js established a best
practice of reserving the first parameter in the callback for errors---that may
or may not occur---during the ~fetch~‐ing process.  The rest of the parameters
could be used to read the results of the asynchronous operation.

#+cindex:callback-based API
#+cindex:traditional asynchronous code
The following shows how ~fetch()~ would look if it had a callback-based API:

#+begin_src js
fetch('/items', (err, res) => {
    if (err) {
        // handle err
    } else {
        // handle response
    }
});
#+end_src

The callback would not be invoked until the =/items= resource had been
retrieved, or an error arose from the fetch operation.  Execution would remain
asynchronous and nonblocking.

*Note* that in this model you could only specify /a single callback/.  That
callback would be responsible for /all/ functionality derived from the
response, and it would be up to the consumer to come up with a mechanism to
compose different aspects of handling the response into that single callback.

*** An Event-Driven Model
#+cindex:event-driven model
#+cindex:events
Besides traditional callbacks, another API design choice might have been to use
an event-driven model.  If this model were implemented by ~fetch~, ~fetch~
would be able to register callbacks for different kinds of events, binding as
many event handlers as needed for any events.  Typically there would be an
=error= event that's raised when things go awry, and other events are raised
when notable things happen.

Here is some code that would be used if ~fetch~ were based upon events:

#+begin_src js
fetch('/items')
    .on('error', err => {
        // handle error
    })
    .on('data', res => {
        // handle response
    })
#+end_src

*Note* that binding several listeners for each type of event would eliminate
the concern we had earlier about having to centralize response handling in a
single callback.

Events, however, make it hard to chain callbacks and have them fire when
another asynchronous task is fulfilled, and that’s where promises come in.
Moreover, events are better suited to handle streams of values, making them
somewhat inappropriate in this particular use case.

*** Asynchronous Fetch Example

#+cindex:@code{fetch()}
: fetch('/items')
makes a "fire and forget" =GET= request against =/items=, meaning you ignore
the response and whether the request succeeded.

#+cindex:Promise
#+cindex:@code{then()} method
#+cindex:@code{response} parameter
The ~fetch()~ method returns a =Promise=.  You can chain the ~then()~ method on
that =Promise=, and the callback will be executed once the =/items= resource
finishes loading, receiving a ~response~ parameter.

: fetch('/items').then(response => {
:     // do something with the response
: })

Here is how ~fetch()~ might be implemented in a browser:

#+begin_src js
const p = fetch('/items');

p.then(res => {
    // handle response
});

p.catch(err => {
    // handle error
});
#+end_src

#+cindex:reaction
#+cindex:fulfillment
#+cindex:fulfillment value
#+cindex:@code{then()} method
#+cindex:@code{catch()} method
#+cindex:rejection
/Reactions/ passed to ~then()~ can be used to handle the /fulfillment/ of a
promise, which is accompanied by a /fulfillment value/; and /reactions/ passed
to ~catch()~ are executed with a /rejection reason/ that can be used when
handling rejections.

#+cindex:register reaction
You can also /register/ a /reaction/ to rejections in the /second/ argument
passed to ~then()~.

#+begin_src js
const p = fetch('/items');
p.then(
    res => {
    // handle response
},
    err => {
    // handle error
});
#+end_src

Another alternative is to omit the /fulfillment reaction/ in ~then(fulfillment,
rejection)~ (use =null= instead).  Using ~then(null, rejection)~ is equivalent
to ~catch(rejection)~.

#+begin_src js
const p = fetch('/items');
p.then(res => {
    // handle response
});
p.then(null, err => {
    // handle error
});
#+end_src

*** Chaining of Promises
#+cindex:chaining of promises
The ~then()~ and ~catch()~ methods return a new =Promise= every time, creating
a tree-like data structure.  That’s important because chaining can have wildly
different results depending on where you append a ~then()~ or a ~catch()~ call.

Assume you have a ~p1~ promise, and ~p1.then()~ returns a ~p2~ promise.  The
~p1~ and ~p2~ promises are nodes connected by the ~p1.then()~ reaction
handler.

Reactions create new promises that are attached to the tree as children of the
promise they are reacting to.

~p1.then(r1).then(r2)~ creates two new promises ~p2~ and ~p3~.  Reaction ~r2~
is going to fire if ~p2~ fulfills, while reaction ~r1~ will fire when ~p1~ is
fulfilled.

Figuring out the tree-like nature of promises is the key to unlocking a deep
understanding of how promises behave.  See the tool [[https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/][Promisees]] to play around
with promise chains while visualizing the tree structure they leave behind.
Promisees lets you write a piece of code and visualize how the underlying graph
evolves as promises are settled in fulfillment or rejection.

*** Creating Promises

**** Using the Promise Constructor

#+cindex:promise creation
#+cindex:Promise constructor
#+cindex:resolver
#+cindex:@code{resolve()} method
#+cindex:@code{reject()} method
#+cindex:settle
#+cindex:pending state
#+cindex:reactions
A promise is created by passing the ~Promise~ constructor a /resolver/ that
decides how and when the promise is settled, by calling either a ~resolve~
method that will /settle the promise in fulfillment/ or a ~reject~ method that
will /settle the promise as a rejection/.  Until the promise is settled by
calling either function, it’ll be in a /pending state/ and any /reactions/
attached to it won’t be executed.

The following snippet of code creates a promise from scratch where we’ll wait
for a second before randomly settling the promise with a fulfillment or
rejection result.

#+begin_src js
new Promise (function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout (function () {
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            resolve('random success')
        } else {
            reject(new Error ('random failure'))
        }
    }, 1000)
})
#+end_src

**** Using the ~resolve()~ and ~reject()~ Methods

Promises can also be created using ~Promise.resolve~ and ~Promise.reject~.
These methods create promises that will immediately settle with a /fulfillment
value/ and a /rejection reason/, respectively.

#+begin_src js
Promise.resolve({ result: 123 }).then(data => console.log(data.result))
// 123
#+end_src

**** Looking at Reactions
When a promise is fulfilled, reactions registered with its ~then()~ method are
executed.  When a promise is rejected, reactions registered with its ~catch()~
method are executed.  Those reactions can, in turn, result in three different
situations depending on whether they
- return a value,
- a ~Promise~,
- a =thenable=, or
- throw an error.


=Thenables= are objects considered promise-like that can be cast into a
~Promise~ using ~Promise.resolve()~.

A reaction may return a /value/, which would cause the promise returned by
~then()~ to become fulfilled with that value.  Promises can be chained to
transform the fulfillment value of the previous promise over and over:

#+begin_src js
Promise
  .resolve(2)
  .then(x => x * 7)
  .then(x => x - 3)
  .then(x => console.log(x))
// 7
#+end_src

A reaction may return a promise.

#+begin_src js
Promise
  .resolve(2)
  .then(x => new Promise(function (resolve) {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(x * 1000), x * 1000)
  }))
  .then(x => console.log(x))
// 2000
#+end_src

A reaction may throw an error, which would cause the promise returned by
~then()~ to become rejected and thus follow the ~catch()~ branch, using said
error as the rejection reason.

#+begin_src js
const p = fetch('/items')
  .then(res => { throw new Error('unexpectedly') })
  .catch(err =>  console.error(err))
#+end_src
*** Promise Continuation and Chaining

#+cindex:@code{catch()} method
When an error happens in a promise resolver, you can catch that error using the
~catch()~ method:

#+begin_src js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('oops')))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
#+end_src

#+cindex:exception in resolver
A promise will settle as a rejection when the resolver calls ~reject()~ or if
an exception is thrown inside the resolver.

#+begin_src js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    throw new Error('oops');
}).catch(err => console.error(err));
#+end_src

Errors that occur while executing a fulfillment or rejection reaction result in
a promise being rejected.

#+begin_src js
Promise
    .resolve(2)
    .then(x => { throw new Error('failed') })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
#+end_src

Decompose the series of chained method calls into variables.

#+begin_src js :results output
const p1 = Promise.resolve(2);
const p2 = p1.then(x => { throw new Error('failed') });
const p3 = p2.catch(err => console.log(err));
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error: failed

If you attached the ~catch()~ reaction to ~p1~, you wouldn't be able to catch
the error originated in the ~then()~ reaction.

As long as an error remains uncaught in a promise chain, a rejection handler
will be able to capture it.  In the following example we’ve introduced an
intermediary ~then()~ call in between ~p2~, where the error originated, and
~p4~, where we attach the rejection reaction.  When ~p2~ settles with a
rejection, ~p3~ becomes settled with a rejection, as it depends on ~p2~
directly.  When ~p3~ settles with a rejection, the rejection handler in ~p4~
fires.

#+begin_src js :results output
const p1 = Promise.resolve(2)
const p2 = p1.then(x => { throw new Error('failed') })
const p3 = p2.then(x => x * 2)
const p4 = p3.catch(err => console.log(err))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error: failed

The following example shows how you could print a statement to the browser con‐
sole by creating a ~p4~ fulfillment handler that depends on ~p3~ to settle
successfully with fulfillment.

#+begin_src js :results output
const p1 = Promise.resolve(2)
const p2 = p1.then(x => { throw new Error('failed') })
const p3 = p2.catch(err => console.log(err))
const p4 = p3.then(() => console.log('crisis averted'))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error: failed
: crisis averted

Similarly, if an error occurred in the ~p3~ rejection handler, we could capture
that one as well using ~catch()~.  The next piece of code shows how an
exception being thrown in ~p3~ could be captured using ~p3.catch()~ just like
with any other errors arising in previous examples.

#+begin_src js :results output
const p1 = Promise.resolve(2)
const p2 = p1.then(x => { throw new Error('failed') })
const p3 = p2.catch(err => { throw new Error('oops') })
const p4 = p3.catch(err => console.log(err))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error: oops

The following example prints ~err.message~ once instead of twice.  That’s
because no errors happened in the first ~catch()~, so the rejection branch for
that promise wasn’t executed.

#+begin_src js
fetch('/items')
    .then(res => res.a.prop.that.does.not.exist)
    .catch(err => console.error(err.message))
    .catch(err => console.error(err.message))
// <- 'Cannot read property "prop" of undefined'
#+end_src

In contrast, the next snippet will print ~err.message~ twice.  It works by
saving a reference to the promise returned by ~then()~, and then tacking two
~catch()~ reactions onto it.  The second ~catch()~ in the previous example was
capturing errors produced in the promise returned from the first ~catch()~, while
in this case both rejection handlers branch off of ~p~.

#+begin_src js
const p = fetch('/items')
  .then(res => res.a.prop.that.does.not.exist)
p.catch(err => console.error(err.message))
p.catch(err => console.error(err.message))
// <- 'Cannot read property "prop" of undefined'
// <- 'Cannot read property "prop" of undefined'
#+end_src

We should observe, then, that promises can be chained arbitrarily.  As we just
saw, you can save a reference to any point in the promise chain and then append
more promises on top of it.  This is one of the fundamental points to
understanding promises.

#+begin_src js
const p1 = fetch('/items')
const p2 = p1.then(res => res.a.prop.that.does.not.exist)
const p3 = p2.catch(err => {})
const p4 = p3.catch(err => console.error(err.message))
#+end_src

Here is an enumeration of what is going on as that piece of code is executed:

1. ~fetch()~ returns a brand new ~p1~ promise.

2. ~p1.then()~ returns a brand new ~p2~ promise, which will react if ~p1~ is
   fulfilled.

3. ~p2.catch()~ returns a brand new ~p3~ promise, which will react if ~p2~ is
   rejected.

4. ~p3.catch()~ returns a brand new ~p4~ promise, which will react if ~p3~ is
   rejected.

5. When ~p1~ is fulfilled, the ~p1.then()~ reaction is executed.

6. Afterwards, ~p2~ is rejected because of an error in the ~p1.then()~
   reaction.

7. Since ~p2~ was rejected, ~p2.catch()~ reactions are executed, and the
   ~p2.then()~ branch is ignored.

8. The ~p3~ promise from ~p2.catch()~ is fulfilled, because it doesn’t produce
   an error or result in a rejected promise.

9. Because ~p3~ was fulfilled, the ~p3.catch()~ is never followed.  The
   ~p3.then()~ branch would’ve been used instead.
*** Creating a Promise
#+cindex:promise creation
A promise can be created by:
- using a function that returns a promise, such as ~fetch()~
- calling ~Promise.resolve()~ or ~Promise.reject()~
- using the Promise constructor function


#+cindex:Promise constructor function
#+cindex:promise resolver function
#+cindex:promise settlement
#+cindex:settle
#+cindex:@code{resolve} function
#+cindex:@code{reject} function
Promises can be created from scratch by using ~new Promise(resolver)~.  The
~resolver~ parameter is a function that will be used to settle the promise.
The ~resolver~ takes two arguments: a ~resolve~ function and a ~reject~
function.

The pair of promises shown in the next snippet are settled in fulfillment and
rejection, respectively.

#+cindex:fulfillment value
- settling the first promise with a fulfillment value of 'result',
- rejecting the second promise with an Error object, specifying 'reason' as its
  message.

#+begin_src js
new Promise(resolve => resolve('result'))
new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('reason')))
#+end_src

#+cindex:fulfill a promise
#+cindex:fulfillment value
#+cindex:result fulfillment value
Usually promises will fulfill with a /result/ such as the response from an Ajax
call, as we’ve seen with ~fetch~.  You’ll definitely want to state the reason
for your rejections---typically wrapping them in an ~Error~ object so that you
can report back a stack trace.  Note that only the first call made to one of
these functions (~resolve()~ or ~reject()~) will have an impact---once a
promise is settled its outcome can’t change.

ECMA-262, 10th Edition, June 2019

** Object.fromEntries
#+cindex:@code{Object.fromEntries}
A proposal[fn:8] for a new static method ~Object.fromEntries~ in ECMAScript for
transforming a list of key-value pairs into an object.

~Object.fromEntries~ is proposed to perform the reverse of ~Object.entries~: it
accepts an iterable of key-value pairs and returns a new object whose own keys
and corresponding values are given by those pairs.

: obj = Object.fromEntries([['a', 0], ['b', 1]]); // { a: 0, b: 1 }

There is no inverse of ~Object.entries~ for constructing objects from key-value
pairs, so to do so one typically must write a helper or inline reducer:

: obj = Array.from(map).reduce((acc, [ key, val ]) => Object.assign(acc, { [key]: val }), {});

This can be written many different ways, and potentially adds noise because
it's not likely to be obviously related to the outward purpose of the function
doing it.
** String.prototype.trimStart and String.prototype.trimEnd
ES5 standardized ~String.prototype.trim~.  All major engines have also
implemented corresponding ~trimLeft~ and ~trimRight~ functions---without any
standard specification.  For consistency with ~padStart~/~padEnd~ we
propose[fn:9] ~trimStart~ and ~trimEnd~ and ~trimLeft~/~trimRight~ as aliases
required for web compatibility.
** Array.prototype.flatMap and Array.prototype.flat

     concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.

  #+attr_texinfo: :options Array.prototype flat ( [ depth ] )

  When the flat method is called with zero or one arguments, the following
  steps are taken:

  1. Let O be ? ToObject(this value).
  2. Let sourceLen be ? ToLength(? Get(O, "length")).
  3. Let depthNum be 1.
  4. If depth is not undefined, then
     a. Set depthNum to ? ToInteger(depth).
  5. Let A be ? ArraySpeciesCreate(O, 0).
  6. Perform ? FlattenIntoArray(A, O, sourceLen, 0, depthNum).
  7. Return A.
  #+end_defmethod

- Array.prototype.flatMap :: first maps each element using a mapping function,
     then flattens the result into a new array.  It is identical to a map
     followed by a flatten of depth 1, but ~flatMap~ is quite often useful and
     merging both into one method is slightly more efficient.

  #+attr_texinfo: :options Array.prototype flatMap ( mapperFunction [, thisArg] )
  #+begin_defmethod
  When the ~flatMap~ method is called with one or two arguments, the following
  steps are taken:

  1. Let O be ? ToObject(this value).
  2. Let sourceLen be ? ToLength(? Get(O, "length")).
  3. If IsCallable(mapperFunction) is false, throw a TypeError exception.
  4. If thisArg is present, let T be thisArg; else let T be undefined.
  5. Let A be ? ArraySpeciesCreate(O, 0).
  6. Perform ? FlattenIntoArray(A, O, sourceLen, 0, 1, mapperFunction, T).
  7. Return A.
  #+end_defmethod
** Optional Catch Binding
This proposal[fn:8] makes a grammatical change to ECMAScript, allowing the
omission of a catch binding in cases where the binding would not be used.  The
grammar change introduced by this proposal allows for the catch binding and its
surrounding parentheses to be omitted, as in

#+caption:Grammar change for optional catch binding

#+begin_src js

  // ...
} catch {
  // ...
}
#+end_src
** Symbol.prototype.description
Proposal[fn:8] to add ~Symbol.prototype.description~ to ECMAScript.

Goal is to expose the =[[Description]]= internal slot of a symbol directly
instead of just indirectly through ~Symbol.prototype.toString~.

- Symbol.prototype.description :: is an accessor property whose ~set~ accessor
     function is undefined.  Its ~get~ accessor function performs the following
     steps:

  1. Let s be the this value.
  2. Let sym be ? thisSymbolValue(s).
  3. Return sym. =[[Description]]=
** Function.prototype.toString Revision
 ECMA-262 proposal[fn:8] to update ~Function.prototype.toString~

- https://tc39.es/Function-prototype-toString-revision/

** JSON Superset
Proposal[fn:8] to make all JSON text valid ECMA-262, i.e., to extend ECMA-262
syntax into a superset of JSON.

{{{heading(Motivation)}}}

ECMAScript claims JSON as a subset in JSON.parse, but (as has been
well-documented) that is not true because JSON strings can contain unescaped
=U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR= and =U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR= characters while
ECMAScript strings cannot.

These exceptions add unnecessary complexity to the specification and increase
the cognitive burden on both implementers and users, allowing for the
introduction of subtle bugs.  Also, as a lesser but concrete corrolary problem,
certain source concatenation and construction tasks currently require
additional steps to process valid JSON into valid ECMAScript before embedding
it.

{{{heading(Proposed Solution)}}}

JSON syntax is defined by [[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm][ECMA-404]] and permanently fixed by [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159][RFC 7159]], but the
=DoubleStringCharacter= and =SingleStringCharacter= productions of ECMA-262 can
be extended to allow unescaped =U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR= and =U+2029 PARAGRAPH
SEPARATOR= characters.

** Well-Formed JSON Stringify
A proposal[fn:8] to prevent ~JSON.stringify~ from returning ill-formed Unicode
strings.

Rather than return unpaired surrogate code points as single UTF-16 code units,
represent them with JSON escape sequences.

* ECMAScript 2020
- https://tc39.es/ecma262/

** String.prototype.matchAll
If I have a string, and either a sticky or a global regular expression which
has multiple capturing groups, I often want to iterate through all of the
matches.

~String#matchAll~ would solve this use case by both providing access to all of
the capturing groups, and not visibly mutating the regular expression object in
question.

Performs a regular expression match of the String representing the this value
against regexp and returns an iterator.  Each iteration result’s value is an
Array object containing the results of the match, or =null= if the String did
not match.

** Promise.allSettled
~Promise.allSettled~ returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of
promise state snapshots, but only after all the original promises have settled,
i.e. become either fulfilled or rejected.

* Modules Systems---CJS and AMD
#+cindex:module systems

JavaScript was originally designed to be read from top to bottom in a
simplistic manner by a web browser, and files were loaded using =<script>=
tags.  As larger and larger applications have been written in JavaScript, two
module systems (AMD and CommonJS) have been developed.  Two patterns exist
because the browser and server offer different challenges in terms of
module-loading latency (network requests vs. file system).

** CommonJS (CJS)
#+cindex:CommonJS module system
#+cindex:CJS
#+cindex:Dongaoor, Kevin
#+cindex:ecosystem for JavaScript modules on the server
Kevin Dongaoor created CommonJS in 2009 with the goal to specify an ecosystem
for JavaScript modules on the server.  Node.js follows the CommonJS module
specification.  Following are a few salient points of the module system:

- Each file is its own module.

  #+cindex:module definition
  #+cindex:@code{module} variable
- Each file has access to the current module definition using the ~module~
  variable.

  #+cindex:@code{module.exports} variable
- The export of the current module is determined by the ~module.exports~
  variable.

  #+cindex:@code{require} function
  #+cindex:import a module
  #+cindex:module import
- To import a module, use the globally available ~require~ function.

** Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
#+cindex:Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
#+cindex:AMD
Node.js follows the CommonJS module specification.  This module system is great
for the server environment when we have immediate access to the file system.
Loading a module from the file system in Node.js is a blocking call for the
first time.

However, if the same module system is used in the browser, each ~require~
statement would need to trigger an HTTP request to the server.  This is an
order of magnitude slower and less reliable than a file system access call.
Loading a large number of modules can quickly degrade the user experience in
the browser.  The solution is async, in-parallel, and upfront loading of
modules.

To support this async loading, we need a way to declare that this file will
depend upon ~./foo~ and ~./bar~ upfront and continue code execution using a
callback.  There is already a specification for exactly this called /async
module definition (AMD)/.

#+caption[Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)]:code snippet to show loading two modules using AMD
#+name: async-module-definition-example
#+begin_src js -n
define(['./foo', './bar'], function(foo, bar){
        // continue code here
});
#+end_src

#+cindex:@code{define} function
#+cindex:RequireJS library
The ~define~ function is not native to the browser.  These must be provided by
a third-party library.  The most popular of these for the browser is [[https://requirejs.org][RequireJS]].
The different nature of the ~require~ call is what makes reusing Node.js code
in the browser slightly more involved.

#+begin_quote
{{{heading(RequireJS)}}}

RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for
in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino
and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed
and quality of your code.
#+end_quote

#+cindex:export from AMD module
To export something from a module, you can simply return it from the ~define~
callback.

#+caption[Export from AMD]:export from an AMD module
#+name:amd-export
#+begin_src define([], function () {
    var foo = function () {
        console.log('foo was called');
    };
    return foo; // function foo is exported
});
#+end_src

The root of the file contains a call to ~define~.  To load modules ~./foo~ and
~./bar~ in ~app.js~ in the same folder, the ~define~ call will be as shown:

#+caption:App.js Root define
#+name:root-define
#+begin_src js -n
define(['./foo', './bar'], function (foo, bar) {
        // use foo and bar here
});
#+end_src

~define~ can take a special argument called ~exports~, which behaves similar to
the ~exports~ variable in Node.js.  Let’s create the module ~bar.js~ using this
syntax, as shown:

#+caption:Bar.js exports
#+name:AMD-exports
#+begin_src js -n
define(['exports'], function (exports) {
    var bar = exports.log = function () {
        console.log('bar.log was called');
    };
});
#+end_src

Note that you can only use ~exports~ to attach variables you want to export
(for example, ~exports.log =~ =/*something*/=), but you cannot assign it to
something else (~exports =~ =/*something*/=) as that would break the reference
to the ~exports~ variable monitored by RequireJS.  This is conceptually quite
similar to the exports variable in Node.js.

Let’s complete ~app.js~ and consume both of these modules, as shown:

#+caption: App.js consuming foo.js and bar.js
#+name:app.js-foo.js-bar.js
#+begin_src js -n
define(['./foo', './bar'], function (foo, bar) {
    foo();
    bar.log();
});
#+end_src

The real benefit of using this alternate (AMD) syntax for modules becomes
evident when we look at the network tab within the chrome debug tools.
~foo.js~ and ~bar.js~ were downloaded in parallel as soon as ~app.js~ was
downloaded, and RequireJS found that ~app.js~ needs ~foo.js~ and ~bar.js~ to
function because of the call to ~define~.

*** Facts about AMD

- Modules are cached.  This is similar to how modules are cached in
  Node.js---that is, the same object is returned every time.

- Many of these arguments to ~define~ are optional and there are various ways
  to configure how modules are scanned in RequireJS.

  #+cindex:@code{require}, AMD function
- You can still do conditional loading of specific modules using a ~require~
  call, which is another function provided by RequireJS.  This function is also
  async and is different from the Node.js version of ~require~.

#+caption[AMD ~require~ function]:how you can conditionally load a module in AMD
#+name:AMD-require
#+begin_src js -n
define(['./foo', './bar'], function(foo, bar){
        if(iReallyNeedThisModule){
                require(['./bas'], function(bas){
                        // continue code here.
                }); 
        }
});

Since 1996, /JavaScript: The Definitive Guide/ has been the bible for
JavaScript programmers---a programmer's guide and comprehensive reference to the
core language and to the client-side JavaScript APIs defined by web browsers.

The 6th edition covers HTML5 and ECMAScript 5.  Many chapters have been
completely rewritten to bring them in line with today's best web development
practices.  New chapters in this edition document jQuery and server side
JavaScript.  It's recommended for experienced programmers who want to learn the
programming language of the Web, and for current JavaScript programmers who
want to master it.

This book covers the JavaScript language and the JavaScript APIs implemented by
web browsers.  It was written for programmers who already use JavaScript but
want to take their understanding to a new level and really master the language
and the web platform.  The goal with this book is to document the JavaScript
language and platform comprehensively and definitively.  It will reward careful
study, and that the time you spend reading it will be easily recouped in the
form of higher programming productivity.

{{{heading(How This Book Is Organized)}}}
This book is divided into four parts.

- Part I covers the JavaScript language itself.
- Part II covers client-side JavaScript: the JavaScript APIs defined by HTML5
  and related standards and implemented by web browsers.
- Part III is the reference section for the core language,
- Part IV is the reference for client-side JavaScript.


{{{subheading(The Sixth Edition)}}}
This sixth edition of the book covers both:

- ECMAScript 5 (the latest version of the core language) and
- HTML5 (the latest version of the web platform)

** Introduction to JavaScript
:PROPERTIES:
:chapter:  One
:END:
JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must
learn:

- HTML to specify the /content/ of web pages
- CSS to specify the /presentation/ of web pages, and
- JavaScript to specify the /behavior/ of web pages.


JavaScript is:

- a high-level,
- dynamic,
- untyped
- interpreted
- programming language

that is well-suited to:

- /object-oriented/ and
- /functional/

programming styles.  JavaScript derives:

- its /syntax/ from *Java*,
- its /first-class functions/ from *Scheme*, and
- its /prototype-based inheritance/ from *Self*.


JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a
robust and efficient general-purpose language.  The latest version of the
language defines new features for serious large-scale software development.

*** Some History of JavaScript the Name
JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language.  “Java-
Script” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to
describe Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language.

Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA---the European
Computer Manufacturer’s Association---and because of trademark issues, the
standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name
“ECMAScript.”  Microsoft’s version of the language is formally known as
“JScript.”  This book uses the name “ECMAScript” only to refer to the language
standard.

*** About Versions
#+cindex:version 3
#+cindex:ECMAScript 3
#+cindex:ES3
For the last decade[fn:5], all web browsers have implemented version 3 of the
ECMAScript standard and there has really been no need to think about version
numbers: the language standard was stable and browser implementations of the
language were, for the most part, interoperable.

#+cindex:version 5
#+cindex:ECMAScript 5
#+cindex:ES5
Recently, an important new version of the language has been defined as
ECMAScript version 5 and, at the time of this writing, browsers are beginning
to implement it.  This book covers all the new features of ECMAScript 5 as well
as all the long-standing features of ECMAScript 3.  You’ll sometimes see these
language versions abbreviated as ES3 and ES5, just as you’ll sometimes see the
name JavaScript abbreviated as JS.

#+cindex:version 4
#+cindex:ECMAScript 4
#+cindex:versino 1.5
#+cindex:V8
The only version numbers that are relevant are ECMAScript versions 3 or 5.
Version 4 was never released.  Sometimes, however, you’ll also see a JavaScript
version number, such as JavaScript 1.5 or JavaScript 1.8.  These are Mozilla’s
version numbers: version 1.5 is basically ECMAScript 3, and later versions
include nonstandard language extensions.  there are also version numbers
attached to particular JavaScript interpreters or “engines.” Google calls its
JavaScript interpreter V8, for example, and at the time of this writing the
current version of the V8 engine is 3.0.

*** About JavaScript's Minimal Standard Library
#+cindex:standard library
#+cindex:input output functionality
#+cindex:host environment
To be useful, every language must have a platform or /standard library/ or API
of functions for performing things like basic input and output.  The core
JavaScript language defines a minimal API for working with /text/, /arrays/,
/dates/, and /regular expressions/ but does not include any /input/ or /output/
functionality.  Input and output (as well as more sophisticated features, such
as /networking/, /storage/, and /graphics/) are the responsibility of the “host
environment” within which JavaScript is embedded.  Usually that host
environment is a web browser, but it can be something else.

*** What This Book Covers
#+cindex:coverage, book
#+cindex:book coverage
This book covers low-level fundamentals first, and then builds on those to more
advanced and higher-level abstractions.

- [[*Core JavaScript][Part I]] of this book covers the language itself and its minimal built-in API.
- [[*Client-Side JavaScript][Part II]] explains how JavaScript is used in web browsers and covers the
  sprawling browser-based APIs loosely known as “client-side JavaScript.”
- [[*Core API Reference][Part III]] is the reference section for the core API.
- [[*Client-Side JavaScript Reference][Part IV]] is the reference section for client-side JavaScript.

#+cindex:Chapter 1
Chapter 1 makes a quick first pass through the core language and the
client-side API, introducing key features that will make it easier to
understand the in-depth treatment in the chapters that follow.

*** An Overview of Core JavaScript
#+cindex:Chapter 2 Lexical Structure
[[*Lexical Structure][Chapter 2, Lexical Structure]], explains things like JavaScript comments,
semicolons, and the Unicode character set.

#+cindex:Chapter 3 Types Values Variables
[[*Types Values and Variables][Chapter 3, Types, Values, and Variables]], explains JavaScript variables and the
values you can assign to those variables.

#+cindex:Chapter 4 Expressions Operators
[[*Expressions and Operators][Chapter 4, Expressions and Operators]] discusses expressions and operators.

- Expression :: a phrase of JavaScript that can be evaluated to produce a
                value.  An expression is something that computes a value but
                doesn’t do anything: it doesn’t alter the program state in any
                way.

  - Operators: produce values


#+cindex:Chapter 5 Statements
[[*Statements][Chapter 5, Statements]]

- Statement :: Statements, on the other hand, don’t have a value (or don’t have
               a value that we care about), but they do alter the state.

  - Variable declarations: create variables

  - Assignment statements: assign values to variables

  - Control structures (conditionals and loops)


#+cindex:Chapter 6 Objects
[[*Objects][Chapter 6, Objects]]

#+cindex:Chapter 7 Arrays
[[*Arrays][Chapter 7, Arrays]]

#+cindex:Chapter 8 Functions
[[*Functions][Chapter 8, Functions]]

- Methods :: When we combine functions with objects, we get methods


#+cindex:Chapter 9 Classes Modules
[[*Classes and Modules][Chapter 9, Classes and Modules]] covers object-oriented programming in JavaScript
in detail, with lots of examples

#+cindex:Chapter 10 Pattern Matching Regular Expressions
[[*JavaScript Subsets and Extensions][Chapter 10, Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions]] explains the regular
expression grammar and demonstrates how to use these “regexps” for textual
pattern matching.

#+cindex:Chapter 11 Subsets Extensions
[[*JavaScript Subsets and Extensions][Chapter 11, JavaScript Subsets and Extensions]] covers subsets and extensions of
core JavaScript

#+cindex:Chapter 12 Server-Side
[[*Server-Side JavaScript][Chapter 12, Server-Side JavaScript]] introduces two ways to use JavaScript
outside of web browsers.

#+cindex:Part Two Client-Side
[[*Client-Side JavaScript][Part Two, Client-Side JavaScript]] is a quick sketch of basic client-side
programming techniques, followed by an in-depth example.

#+cindex:Chapter 13 JS in Web Browsers
[[*JavaScript in Web Browsers][Chapter 13, JavaScript in Web Browsers]] explains in detail how to put JavaScript
to work in web browsers.

#+cindex:Chapter 14 Window Object
[[*The Window Object][Chapter 14, The Window Object]] explains techniques for scripting the web browser
and covers some important global functions of client-side JavaScript.

#+cindex:Chapter 15 Scripting Documents
[[*Scripting Documents][Chapter 15, Scripting Documents]] shows you how to select particular HTML
elements from within a document, how to set HTML attributes of those elements,
how to alter the content of those elements, and how to add new elements to the
document; i.e., it shows how JavaScript can script the HTML elements that
define web content.

#+cindex:Chapter 16 Scripting CSS
[[*Scripting CSS][Chapter 16, Scripting CSS]] shows how you can use JavaScript with the CSS styles
that define the presentation of that content.

#+cindex:Chapter 17 Events
[[*Handling Events][Chapter 17, Handling Events]] explains how you can define and register event
handlers and how the browser invokes them when events occur.

Chapters 15, 16, and 17 explain how you can use JavaScript to script the
content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (event handling) of web pages.
The APIs described in those chapters are somewhat complex and, until recently,
riddled with browser incompatibilities.  For these reasons, many or most
client-side JavaScript programmers choose to use a client-side library or
framework to simplify their basic programming tasks.  The most popular such
library is *jQuery*.

#+cindex:Chapter 19 jQuery Library
[[*The jQuery Library][Chapter 19, The jQuery Library]], discusses jQuery, which defines a clever and
easy-to-use API for scripting document content, presentation, and behavior.

The four chapters of Part II described so far have all really been about web
pages.  Four more chapters shift gears to focus on web applications.  These
chapters are not about using web browsers to display documents with scriptable
content, presentation, and behavior.  Instead, they’re about using web browsers
as application platforms, and they describe the APIs that modern browsers
provide to support sophisticated client-side web apps.

#+cindex:Chapter 18 Scripted HTTP
[[*Scripted HTTP][Chapter 18, Scripted HTTP]] explains how to make scripted HTTP requests with
JavaScript—a kind of networking API.

#+cindex:Chapter 20 Storage Client-Side
[[*Client-Side Storage][Chapter 20, Client-Side Storage]] describes mechanisms for storing data---and
even entire applications---on the client side for use in future browsing
sessions.

#+cindex:Chapter 21 Scripted Media Graphics
[[*Scripted Media and Graphics][Chapter 21, Scripted Media and Graphics]] covers a client-side API for drawing
arbitrary graphics in an HTML =<canvas>= tag.

#+cindex:Chapter 22 HTML5 APIs
[[*HTML5 APIs][Chapter 22, HTML5 APIs]] covers an assortment of new web app APIs specified by or
affiliated with HTML5.  Networking, storage, graphics: these are OS-type
services being provided by the web browser, defining a new cross-platform
application environment.

*** An Extended Example --- LoanCalc
- [[file:LoanCalc.org][LoanCalc]]

This chapter ends with an extended example that puts many of these techniques
together and shows what real-world client-side JavaScript (plus HTML and CSS)
programs look like.

[[file:figs/loancalc-50.png]]

** Core JavaScript
#+cindex:reference, language
#+cindex:language reference
This part of the book, Chapters 2 though 12, documents the core JavaScript
language and is meant to be a JavaScript language reference.

*** Lexical Structure
#+cindex:Chapter 2 Lexical Structure
#+cindex:lexical structure, def
#+cindex:syntax
The /lexical structure/ of a programming language is the set of elementary
rules that specifies how you write programs in that language.  It is the
lowest-level syntax of a language; it specifies such things as what variable
names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one program
statement is separated from the next.

This short chapter documents the lexical structure of JavaScript.

**** Character Set
#+cindex:character set
#+cindex:Unicode
JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set.  ECMAScript 3
requires JavaScript implementations to support Unicode version 2.1 or later.
ECMAScript 5 requires implementations to support Unicode 3 or later.

See [[characters-codepoints-strings][Characters---Codepoints---and Strings]] for more about Unicode and
JavaScript.

***** Case Sensitivity
#+cindex:identifiers
#+cindex:case sensitive
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.  This means that language keywords,
variables, function names, and other {{{dfn(identifiers)}}} must always be
typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

#+cindex:HTML
#+cindex:XHTML
Note, however, that HTML is not case-sensitive (although XHTML is).  Because of
its close association with client-side JavaScript, this difference can be
confusing.  Many client-side JavaScript objects and properties have the same
names as the HTML tags and attributes they represent.  While these tags and
attribute names can be typed in any case in HTML, in JavaScript they typically
must be all lowercase.

For example, the HTML ~onclick~ event handler attribute is sometimes specified
as ~onClick~ in HTML, but it must be specified as ~onclick~ in JavaScript code
(or in XHTML documents).

***** Whitespace---Line Breaks---and Format Control Characters
JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs.  For the most
part, JavaScript also ignores line breaks (but see [[*Optional Semicolons---Required Semicolons][Optional Semicolons]] for an
exception).

{{{heading(Whitespace)}}}

#+cindex:whitespace characters
In addition to the regular space character (\u0020), JavaScript also recognizes
the following characters as whitespace:

#+cindex:space
- space :: \u0020
  #+cindex:tab
- tab :: \u0009
  #+cindex:vertical tab
- vertical tab :: \u000B
  #+cindex:form feed
- form feed :: \u000C
  #+cindex:nonbreaking space
- nonbreaking space :: \u00A0
  #+cindex:byte order mark
- byte order mark :: \uFEFF
  #+cindex:Unicode category Z
- Unicode category :: Zs


{{{heading(Line Delimiters)}}}

#+cindex:line delimiters
JavaScript recognizes the following characters as line terminators:

  #+cindex:line feed
- line feed :: \u000A
  #+cindex:carriage return
- carriage return :: \u000D
  #+cindex:line separator
- line separator :: \u2028
  #+cindex:paragraph separator
- paragraph separator :: \u2029
  #+cindex:carriage return---line feed
- carriage return --- line feed :: treated as a single line terminator


{{{heading(Unicode format control characters)}}}

#+cindex:Unicode format control characters
#+cindex:format control characters
Unicode format control characters (category Cf), such as =RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK=
(\u200F) and =LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK= (\u200E), control the visual presentation of
the text they occur in.  They are important for the proper display of some
non-English languages and are allowed in JavaScript comments, string literals,
and regular expression literals, but not in the identifiers (e.g., variable
names) of a JavaScript program.

{{{heading(Zero Width Joiners)}}}

As a special case, =ZERO WIDTH JOINER= (\u200D) and =ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER=
(\u200C) are allowed in identifiers, but not as the first character.  As noted
above, the byte order mark format control character (\uFEFF) is treated as a
space character.

***** Unicode Escape Sequences
#+cindex:Unicode characters
#+cindex:Unicode codepoint
Some computer hardware and software can not display or input the full set of
Unicode characters. To support programmers using this older technology,
JavaScript defines special sequences of six ASCII characters to represent any
16-bit Unicode codepoint.

#+cindex:Unicode escape sequences
These Unicode escapes begin with the characters =\u= and are followed by
exactly four hexadecimal digits (using uppercase or lowercase letters =A–F=).

Unicode escapes may appear in
- JavaScript string literals,
- regular expression literals, and in
- identifiers (but not in language keywords)


The Unicode escape for the character =é=, for example, is \u00E9, and the
following two JavaScript strings are identical:

: "café" === "caf\u00e9" // => true

**** Comments
#+cindex:comments

**** Literals
#+cindex:literals

**** Identifiers and Reserved Words
#+cindex:identifiers
#+cindex:reserved words

**** Optional Semicolons---Required Semicolons
#+cindex:semicolons
JavaScript uses the semicolon (=;=) to separate statements from each other.  In
JavaScript, you can usually omit the semicolon between two statements if those
statements are written on separate lines.  (You can also omit a semicolon at
the end of a program or if the next token in the program is a closing curly
brace =}=.)

Many JavaScript programmers (and the code in this book) use semicolons to
explicitly mark the ends of statements, even where they are not required.

Another style is to omit semicolons whenever possible, using them only in the
few situations that require them.

Whichever style you choose, there are a few details you should understand about
optional semicolons in JavaScript.

#+cindex:line break, as semicolon
Note that JavaScript does not treat every line break as a semicolon: it usually
treats line breaks as semicolons only if it can’t parse the code without the
semicolons.  More formally (and with two exceptions described below),
JavaScript treats a line break as a semicolon if the next nonspace character
cannot be interpreted as a continuation of the current statement.

These statement termination rules lead to some surprising cases.  This code
looks like two separate statements separated with a newline:

#+begin_src js -n
var y = x + f
(a+b).toString()
#+end_src

But the parentheses on the second line of code can be interpreted as a function
invocation of ~f~ from the first line, and JavaScript interprets the code like
this:

: var y = x + f(a+b).toString();

#+cindex:explicit semicolon required
#+cindex:semicolon, required explicit
More likely than not, this is not the interpretation intended by the author of
the code.  In order to work as two separate statements, an explicit semicolon
is required in this case.

In general, if a statement begins with:

: ( [ / + -

{{{noindent}}}there is a chance that it could be interpreted as a continuation
of the statement before.  Statements beginning with =/ + -= are quite rare in
practice, but statements beginning with =( [= are not uncommon at all, at least
in some styles of JavaScript programming.

Some programmers like to put a defensive semicolon at the beginning of any such
statement so that it will continue to work correctly even if the statement
before it is modified and a previously terminating semicolon removed:

#+begin_src js -n
var x = 0 			  // semicolon omitted here
;[x,x+1,x+2].forEach(console.log) // defensive ; keeps this statement separate
#+end_src

{{{heading(Exceptions to General Rule of Line Breaks)}}}

There are two exceptions to the general rule that JavaScript interprets line
breaks as semicolons when it cannot parse the second line as a continuation of
the statement on the first line.

1. The first exception involves the ~return~, ~break~, and ~continue~
   statements.  These statements often stand alone, but they are sometimes
   followed by an identifier or expression.  If a line break appears after any
   of these words (before any other tokens), JavaScript will *always* interpret
   that line break as a semicolon.

   #+begin_src js -n
   return
   true;
   #+end_src

   {{{noindent}}}JavaScript assumes you meant:

   : return; true;

   {{{noindent}}}However, you probably meant:

   : return true;

   What this means is that you must not insert a line break between ~return~,
   ~break~ or ~continue~ and the expression that follows the keyword.  If you
   do insert a line break, your code is likely to fail in a nonobvious way that
   is difficult to debug.

2. The second exception involves the ~++~ and ~−−~ operators.  These operators
   can be prefix operators that appear before an expression or postfix
   operators that appear after an expression.  /If you want to use either of
   these operators as postfix operators, they must appear on the same line as
   the expression they apply to/.  Otherwise, the line break will be treated as
   a semicolon, and the ~++~ or ~--~ will be parsed as a prefix operator
   applied to the code that follows.

   #+begin_src js -n
   x
   ++
   y
   #+end_src

   {{{noindent}}}is parsed as:

   : x; ++y;

   {{{noindent}}}not as:

   : x++; y;

*** Types Values and Variables
#+cindex:Chapter 3 Types Values Variables
#+cindex:types, def
#+cindex:values, def
Computer programs work by manipulating values.  The kinds of values that can be
represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as /types/, and
one of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the
set of types it supports.

#+cindex:variable, def
When a program needs to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to
(or “stores” the value in) a variable.  A /variable/ defines a symbolic name
for a value and allows the value to be referred to by name.

The way that variables work is another fundamental characteristic of any
programming language.  This chapter explains types, values, and variables in
JavaScript.

{{{heading(JavaScript Types Categories)}}}

#+cindex:primitive types
#+cindex:object types
#+cindex:types, categories
JavaScript types can be divided into two categories:

#+cindex:numbers, primitive
#+cindex:strings, primitive
#+cindex:booleans, primitive
#+cindex:null, primitive
#+cindex:undefined, primitive
- primitive types :: JavaScript’s primitive types include /numbers/, strings of
     text (known as /strings/), and Boolean truth values (known as /booleans/).
     The special JavaScript values /null/ and /undefined/ are primitive values,
     but they are not numbers, strings, or booleans.  Each value is typically
     considered to be the sole member of its own special type.

#+cindex:object types
#+cindex:type object
#+cindex:properties, def
- object types :: Any JavaScript value that is not a number, a string, a
                  boolean, or null or undefined is an /object/.  An /object/
                  (that is, a member of the type =object=) is a collection of
                  /properties/ where each property has a name and a value (either
                  a primitive value, such as a number or string, or an object).


{{{heading(About Object Types)}}}

#+cindex:object, ordinary
- An ordinary JavaScript object is an unordered collection of named values.

  #+cindex:object array
  #+cindex:array object
  #+cindex:ordered collection of values, array
- The language also defines a special kind of object, known as an /array/, that
  represents an ordered collection of numbered values.  The JavaScript language
  includes special syntax for working with arrays, and arrays have some special
  behavior that distinguishes them from ordinary objects.

  #+cindex:object function
  #+cindex:function object
- JavaScript defines another special kind of object, known as a /function/.  A
  function is an object that has executable code associated with it.  A
  function may be invoked to run that executable code and return a computed
  value.  Like arrays, functions behave differently from other kinds of
  objects, and JavaScript defines a special language syntax for working with
  them.  The most important thing about functions in JavaScript is that /they
  are true values/ and that JavaScript programs can treat them like regular
  objects.

  #+cindex:object constructor
  #+cindex:constructor object
  #+cindex:constructor function
  #+cindex:class of objects
  #+cindex:object class, constructor function
- Functions that are written to be used (with the ~new~ operator) to initialize
  a newly created object are known as /constructors/.  Each constructor defines a
  class of objects—--the set of objects initialized by that constructor.

  #+cindex:object class
  #+cindex:class object
  #+cindex:subtype of object, class
- /Classes/ can be thought of as subtypes of the object type.  In addition to
  the Array and Function classes, core JavaScript defines three other useful
  classes.  You can define your own classes of objects by defining appropriate
  constructor functions.

    #+cindex:Date class
  - The /Date class/ defines objects that represent dates.

    #+cindex:RegExp class
    #+cindex:regular expressions, RegExp class
  - The /RegExp class/ defines objects that represent regular expressions.

    #+cindex:Error class
  - The /Error class/ defines objects that represent syntax and runtime errors
    that can occur in a JavaScript program.


{{{heading(Garbage Collection of Objects)}}}

#+cindex:garbage collection
The JavaScript interpreter performs automatic garbage collection for memory
management.  This means that a program can create objects as needed, and the
programmer never needs to worry about destruction or deallocation of those
objects.  When an object is no longer reachable—--when a program no longer has
any way to refer to it---the interpreter knows it can never be used again and
automatically reclaims the memory it was occupying.

{{{heading(JavaScript is Object-Oriented)}}}

#+cindex:object-oriented language
JavaScript is an /object-oriented/ language.  Loosely, this means that rather
than having globally defined functions to operate on values of various types,
the types themselves define methods for working with values.

Technically, it is only JavaScript objects that have methods.  But numbers,
strings, and boolean values behave as if they had methods.

In JavaScript, =null= and =undefined are the only values that methods cannot be
invoked on.

{{{heading(Mutability)}}}

#+cindex:mutable types
#+cindex:immutable types
#+cindex:mutability types
JavaScript’s types can be categorized as /mutable/ and /immutable/ types.  A
value of a mutable type can change.  Objects and arrays are mutable.  Numbers,
booleans, =null=, and =undefined= are immutable---it doesn’t even make sense to
talk about changing the value of a number, for example.  Strings can be thought
of as arrays of characters, and you might expect them to be mutable.  In
JavaScript, however, strings are immutable: you can access the text at any
index of a string, but JavaScript provides no way to alter the text of an
existing string.

{{{heading(Dynamic Type Conversion)}}}

#+cindex:type conversion
#+cindex:conversion of types
JavaScript converts values liberally from one type to another.  If a program
expects a string, for example, and you give it a number, it will automatically
convert the number to a string for you.  If you use a nonboolean value where a
boolean is expected, JavaScript will convert accordingly.

JavaScript’s liberal value conversion rules affect its definition of equality,
and the == equality operator performs type conversions.

{{{heading(Variables)}}}

{{{subheading(Untyped)}}}

#+cindex:untyped variables
#+cindex:variabes, untyped
JavaScript variables are /untyped/: you can assign a value of any type to a
variable, and you can later assign a value of a different type to the same
variable.

{{{subheading(Declarations)}}}

#+cindex:variable declarations
#+cindex:declare
#+cindex:@code{var} keyword
#+cindex:keyword @code{var}
Variables are /declared/ with the ~var~ keyword.

{{{subheading(Lexical Scope)}}}

#+cindex:lexical scope
#+cindex:scope, lexical
JavaScript uses /lexical scoping/.

{{{subheading(Global Variables)}}}

#+cindex:global variable
#+cindex:variable, global
Variables declared outside of a function are /global variables/ and are visible
everywhere in a JavaScript program.

{{{subheading(Function Scope)}}}

#+cindex:function scope
#+cindex:scope, function
Variables declared inside a function have /function scope/ and are visible only
to code that appears inside that function.

**** Numbers

**** Text
#+cindex:string, dfn
#+cindex:Unicode
#+cindex:length, string, dfn
#+cindex:empty string, dfn
A {{{dfn(string)}}} is an immutable ordered sequence of 16-bit values, each of
which typically represents a Unicode character---strings are JavaScript's type
for representing text.  The {{{dfn(length)}}} of a string is the number of
16-bit values it contains.  JavaScript's strings (and its arrays) use
zero-based indexing.  The {{{dfn(empty string)}}} is the string of length 0.

#+texinfo:@cartouche
{{{heading(Characters---Codepoints---and JavaScript Strings)}}}
<<characters-codepoints-strings>>

#+cindex:codepoints
#+cindex:characters
#+cindex:UTF-16 encoding
#+cindex:encoding, UTF-16
#+cindex:Unicode
#+cindex:character set, Unicode
JavaScrupt uses the UTF-16 encoding of the Unicode character set, and
JavaScript strings are sequences of unsigned 16-bit values.  The most commonly
used Unicode characters (those from the ``basic multilinqual plane'') have
codepoints that fit in 16 bits and can be represented by a single element of a
string.

#+cindex:surrogate pair, dfn
Unicode characters whose codepoints do not fit in 16 bits are encoded following
the rules of UTF-16 as a sequence (known as a {{{dfn(surrogate pair)}}}) of two
16-bit values.  This means that a JavaScript string of length 2 (two 16-bti
values) might represent only a single Unicode character.

#+begin_example
var p = "π"; // π is 1 character with 16-bit codepoint 0x03c0
var e = "e"; // e is 1 character with 17-bit codepoint 0x1d452
p.length     // => 1: p consists of 1 16-bit element
e.length     // => 2: UTF-16 encoding of e is 2 16-bit values:
	     //    "\ud835\udc52"
#+end_example

#+cindex:string manipulation methods and Unicode
The various string-manipulation methods defined by JavaScript operate on 16-bit
values, not on characters.  They do not treat surrogate pairs specially,
perform no normalization of the string, and do not even ensure that a string is
well-formed UTF-16.

*** Expressions and Operators
#+cindex:Chapter 4 Expressions and Operators
#+cindex:expression
#+cindex:evaluate
An /expression/ is a phrase of JavaScript that a JavaScript interpreter can
/evaluate/ to produce a /value/.  A constant embedded literally in your program
is a very simple kind of expression.  A variable name is also a simple
expression that evaluates to whatever value has been assigned to that variable.
Complex expressions are built from simpler expressions.

#+cindex:operator, complex expression
#+cindex:operator, returns a value
#+cindex:operator, evaulates to a value
The most common way to build a complex expression out of simpler expressions is
with an /operator/.  An operator comb`ines the values of its /operands/
(usually two of them) in some way and evaluates to a new value.  For
simplicity, we sometimes say that an operator /returns/ a value rather than
“evaluates to” a value.

This chapter documents all of JavaScript’s operators, and it also explains
expressions (such as array indexing and function invocation) that do not use
operators.

*** Statements
#+cindex:Chapter 5 Statements
#+cindex:statements
/Statements/ are JavaScript sentences or commands.  Just as English sentences
are terminated and separated from each other with periods, JavaScript
statements are terminated with semicolons.  Expressions are /evaluated/ to
produce a value, but statements are /executed/ to make something happen.

{{{heading(Side Effects)}}}

#+cindex:side effect
#+cindex:expression statement
#+cindex:declaration statement
#+cindex:statements, types
One way to “make something happen” is to evaluate an expression that has side
effects.  Expressions with side effects, such as /assignments/ and /function
invocations/, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way they are
known as /expression statements/.  A similar category of statements are the
/declaration statements/ that /declare/ new variables and /define/ new
functions.

{{{heading(Control Structures)}}}

#+cindex:control structures
JavaScript programs are nothing more than a sequence of statements to execute.
By default, the JavaScript interpreter executes these statements one after
another in the order they are written.  Another way to “make something happen”
is to alter this default order of execution, and JavaScript has a number of
statements or /control structures/ that do just this:

#+cindex:conditionals
- /Conditionals/ are statements like ~if~ and ~switch~; that make the JavaScript
  interpreter execute or skip other statements depending on the value of an
  expression.

  #+cindex:loops
- /Loops/ are statements like ~while~ and ~for~ that execute other statements
  repetitively.

  #+cindex:jumps
- /Jumps/ are statements like ~break~, ~return~, and ~throw~ that cause the
  interpreter to jump to another part of the program.


The sections that follow describe the various statements in JavaScript and
explain their syntax.

**** Summary of JavaScript Statements

*** Objects
#+cindex:Chapter 6 Objects
#+cindex:objects, intro
JavaScript’s fundamental datatype is the /object/.

#+cindex:composite value, object
- An object is a /composite value/: it aggregates multiple values (primitive
  values or other objects) and allows you to store and retrieve those values by
  name.

  #+cindex:unordered collection of properties, object
- An object is an /unordered collection of properties/, each of which has a
  name and a value.  Property names are strings, so we can say that objects map
  strings to values.

  #+cindex:protoype object
  #+cindex:protoypal inheritance
- An object is more than a simple string- to-value map, however.  In addition
  to maintaining its own set of properties, a JavaScript object also inherits
  the properties of another object, known as its “prototype.”  The methods of
  an object are typically inherited properties, and this “prototypal inheri-
  tance” is a key feature of JavaScript.

  #+cindex:dynamic, objects
  #+cindex:objects, dynamic
  #+cindex:static objects, structs
- JavaScript objects are /dynamic/---properties can usually be added and
  deleted---but they can be used to simulate the static objects and “structs”
  of statically typed languages.  They can also be used (by ignoring the value
  part of the string-to-value mapping) to represent sets of strings.

  #+cindex:object value
- Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, true, false, =null=,
  or =undefined= is an object.  And even though strings, numbers, and booleans
  are not objects, they behave like immutable objects

- The most common things to do with objects are /create/ them and to /set/,
  /query/, /delete/, /test/, and /enumerate/ their properties.

  #+cindex:property as string
  #+cindex:value of object
  #+cindex:getter function
  #+cindex:setter function
- A /property/ has a name and a value.

  - A /property name/ may be any string, including the empty string, but no
    object may have two properties with the same name.

  - The /value/ may be any JavaScript value, or (in ECMAScript 5) it may be a
    getter or a setter function (or both).

{{{heading(Property Attributes)}}}

  #+cindex:property attributes
- In addition to its name and value, each property has associated values that
  we’ll call /property attributes/:

    #+cindex:writable attribute
  - The /writable attribute/ specifies whether the value of the property can be
    set.

    #+cindex:enumerable attribute
  - The /enumerable attribute/ specifies whether the property name is returned
    by a for/in loop.

    #+cindex:configurable attribute
  - The /configurable attribute/ specifies whether the property can be deleted
    and whether its attributes can be altered.

  #+cindex:ECMAScript 5 feature
  #+cindex:configure attributes
- Prior to ECMAScript 5, all properties in objects created by your code are
  writable, enumerable, and configurable.  In ECMAScript 5, you can configure
  the attributes of your properties.

{{{heading(Object Attributes)}}}

  #+cindex:object properties
- In addition to its properties, every object has three associated /object
  attributes/:

  #+cindex:prototype reference
  - An object’s /prototype/ is a reference to another object from which
    properties are inherited.

    #+cindex:object class
  - An object’s /class/ is a string that categorizes the type of an object.

    #+cindex:extensible flag
    #+cindex:ECMAScript 5 feature
  - An object’s /extensible flag/ specifies (in ECMAScript 5) whether new
    properties may be added to the object.


Finally, here are some terms we’ll use to distinguish among three broad
categories of JavaScript objects and two types of properties:

 #+cindex:native object 
- A /native object/ is an object or class of objects defined by the ECMAScript
  specifi- cation. Arrays, functions, dates, and regular expressions (for
  example) are native objects.

  #+cindex:host object
- A /host object/ is an object defined by the host environment (such as a web
  browser) within which the JavaScript interpreter is embedded. The HTMLElement
  objects that represent the structure of a web page in client-side JavaScript
  are host objects. Host objects may also be native objects, as when the host
  environment defines methods that are normal JavaScript Function objects.

  #+cindex:user-defined object
- A /user-defined/ object is any object created by the execution of JavaScript
  code.

  #+cindex:own property
- An /own property/ is a property defined directly on an object.

  #+cindex:inherited property
- An /inherited property/ is a property defined by an object’s prototype
  object.

*** Preface

{{{heading(In-Depth Coverage Topics)}}}

A real need for in-depth coverage of the most important parts of the JavaScript
language:
#+cindex:functions
- functions
  #+cindex:closures
- closures
  #+cindex:protyptes
- prototypes
  #+cindex:cross-browser code
- cross-browser code


{{{heading(The Fundamentals)}}}

There isn’t any point to diving into new technologies if you don’t have a
proper understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the JavaScript
language.  The reality is that most development needs to make sure that code
continues to work in the majority of browsers and for the majority of potential
users.

{{{heading(jQuery)}}}

#+cindex:jQuery
Perhaps the largest change that came to jQuery as a result of writing this book
was a complete overhaul from using browser-specific sniffing to using feature
detection at the core of the library.  This has enabled jQuery to be used
almost indefinitely, without assuming that browsers would always have specific
bugs or be missing specific features.

#+cindex:cross-browser capabilities
Using the techniques outlined in this book, jQuery’s cross-browser capabilities
provide a fairly solid guarantee that code written with jQuery will work in a
maximum number of browser environments.  This guarantee has led to explosive
growth in jQuery over the past four years, with it now being used in over 57%
of the top 10,000 websites on the Internet, according to BuiltWith.com.

{{{heading(New JS-Based Languages)}}}

#+cindex:CoffeeScript
#+cindex:Processing.js
#+cindex:ECMAScript specification
There are now a number of active programming languages that are built on top
of, or compiled to, JavaScript, such as CoffeeScript and Processing.js.  These
languages require complex language parsing, code evaluation, and scope
manipulation in order to work effectively.  Although dynamic code evaluation
has been maligned due to its complexity and potential for security issues,
without it we wouldn’t have had the CoffeeScript programming language, which
has gone on to influence the upcoming ECMAScript specification itself.

{{{heading(The Future)}}}

#+cindex:browser APIs
The future for browser development continues to be very strong, and it’s
largely due to the features encapsulated in JavaScript and in the browser APIs.
Having a solid grasp of the most crucial parts of the JavaScript language,
combined with a desire for writing code that’ll work in many browsers, will
enable you to create code that’s elegant, fast, and ubiquitous.

*** About this Book
Web developers need to have a sound grasp of the language that brings life to
web applications.

#+cindex:Rhino
#+cindex:V8
#+cindex:Node.js
JavaScript isn’t just for browsers anymore.  The language has knocked down the
walls of the browser and is being used on the server in engines such as Rhino
and V8, and in frameworks like Node.js.

Although this book is primarily focused on JavaScript for web applications, the
fundamentals of the language presented in [[*Part 2---Apprentice Training][Part 2]] of this book are applicable
across the board.

It’s now more important than ever that they grasp its fundamentals, so that
they can become true ninjas of the language.

{{{heading(Intended Audience)}}}

#+cindex:audience
This book is aimed at web developers who already have at least a basic grasp of
JavaScript.
- You should understand the basic structure of JavaScript statements and
- how they work to create straightforward on-page scripts.
- You don’t need to be an advanced user of the language---that’s what this book
  is for---but
- you shouldn’t be a rank novice.
- You should also have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- You should know the basics of putting a web page together.

**** Roadmap
This book is organized to take you from an apprentice to a ninja in four parts.

1. [[*Part 1---Preparing for Training][Part 1]] introduces the topic and some tools we’ll need as we progress through
   the rest of the book.

   #+cindex:advanced web applications, problems
   - [[*Enter the Ninja][Chapter 1]] introduces us to the challenges that we face as writers of
     advanced web applications.  It presents some of the problems that the
     proliferation of browsers creates, and suggests best current practices
     that we should follow when developing our applications, including testing
     and performance analysis.

     #+cindex:testing
     #+cindex:test tools
     #+cindex:assert
   - [[*Arming with Testing and Debugging][Chapter 2]] discusses testing, taking a look at the current state of testing
     and test tools.  It also introduces a small but powerful testing concept,
     the ~assert~, which will be used extensively throughout the remainder of
     the book to make sure that our code does what we think it should be doing
     (or sometimes to prove that it doesn’t!).

     #+cindex:JavaScript fundamentals
2. [[*Part 2---Apprentice Training][Part 2]] focuses on JavaScript fundamentals: aspects of the language that you
   take for granted but aren’t really sure how they work.  This may be the most
   important part of the book, and even if it’s all you read, you’ll come away
   with a much sounder understanding of JavaScript, the language.

   #+cindex:functions
   #+cindex:functional language
   - Armed with these tools, [[*Functions are Fundamental][chapter 3]] begins our foray into the fundamentals
     of the language, starting, perhaps to your surprise, with a thorough
     examination of the function as defined by JavaScript.  Although you might
     have expected the object to be the target of first focus, it’s a solid
     understanding of the function, and JavaScript as a functional language,
     that begins our transformation from run-of-the-mill JavaScript coders to
     JavaScript ninjas!

     #+cindex:recursion
     #+cindex:variable argument lists
     #+cindex:overload functions
     #+cindex:method overloading
     #+cindex:functional programming
   - Not being done with functions quite yet, [[*Wielding Functions][chapter 4]] takes the fundamentals
     we learned in chapter 3 and applies them to problems we face in creating
     our applications.  We’ll explore recursion—not only for its own sake, but
     because we can learn a lot more about functions through scrutinizing
     it---and we’ll learn how the functional programming aspects of JavaScript
     can be applied to not only make our code elegant, but also more robust and
     succinct.  We’ll learn ways to deal with variable argument lists, and ways
     to overload functions in a language that doesn’t natively support the
     object-oriented concept of method overloading.

     #+cindex:closures
     #+cindex:functional programming
     #+cindex:scope
   - One of the most important concepts you can take away from this book is the
     subject of [[*Object-orientation with Prototypes][chapter 5]]: closures.  A key concept in functional programming,
     closures allow us to exert fine-grained control over the scope of objects
     that we declare and create in our programs.  The control of these scopes
     is the key factor in writing code worthy of a ninja.  Even if you stop
     reading after this chapter (but we hope that you don’t), you’ll be a far
     better JavaScript developer than when you started.

     #+cindex:objects
     #+cindex:prototype property
     #+cindex:functions and the prototype property
   - Objects are finally addressed in [[*Object-orientation with Prototypes][chapter 6]], where we learn how patterns of
     objects can be created through the prototype property of the function, and
     we’ll learn how objects are tied to functions for their definitions---one
     of the many reasons we discussed functions first.

     #+cindex:regular expressions
   - [[*Wrangling Regular Expressions][Chapter 7]] focuses on the regular expression, an often-overlooked feature
     of the language that can do the work of scores of lines of code when used
     correctly.  We’ll learn how to construct and use regular expressions and
     how to solve some recurring problems elegantly, using regular expressions
     and the methods that work with them.

     #+cindex:timers
     #+cindex:intervals
     #+cindex:single-threaded model
     #+cindex:HTML5
     #+cindex:web workers
   - Part 2 on language fundamentals closes out with [[*Taming Threads and Timers][chapter 8]], in which we
     learn how timers and intervals work in the single-threaded nature of
     JavaScript.  HTML5 promises to bring us relief from the confines of the
     single thread with web workers, but most browsers aren’t quite there yet,
     and virtually all of the existing JavaScript code depends upon a good
     understanding of JavaScript’s single-threaded model.

     #+cindex:problems, solve
3. In [[*Part 3---Ninja Training][part 3]], we dive into using the fundamentals that we learned in part 2 to
   solve knotty problems that the browsers throw at us.

   #+cindex:runtime code evaluation
   #+cindex:evaluate code while running
   #+cindex:JSON evaluation
   #+cindex:metalanguages
   #+cindex:domain-specific languages
   #+cindex:compression
   #+cindex:obfuscation
   #+cindex:aspect-oriented programming
   - Part 3 opens with [[*Ninja Alchemy - Runtime Code Evaluation][chapter 9]], in which we open the black box of
     JavaScript’s runtime code evaluation.  We’ll look at various ways to
     evaluate code on the fly, including how to do so safely and in the scope
     of our choosing.  Real-world examples, such as JSON evaluation,
     metalanguages (a.k.a. domain-specific languages), compression and
     obfuscation, and even aspect-oriented programming, are discussed.

     #+cindex:with statement
   - In [[*=with= Statements][chapter 10]], we examine the controversial ~with~ statement, which is
     used to shorten references within a scope.  Whether you are a fan or
     detractor of ~with~, it exists in a lot of code in the wild, and you
     should understand it regardless of whether you think it’s the bomb or an
     abomination.

     #+cindex:cross-browser issues
     #+cindex:browser differences
     #+cindex:browser bugs,fixes
     #+cindex:browers, missing features
     #+cindex:feature simulation
     #+cindex:object detection
   - Dealing with cross-browser issues is the subject of [[*Developing Cross-Browser Strategies][chapter 11]].  We
     examine the five key development concerns with regard to these issues:
     browser differences, bugs and bug fixes, external code and markup, missing
     features, and regressions.  Strategies such as feature simulation and
     object detection are discussed at length to help us deal with these
     cross-browser challenges.

     #+cindex:element attributes, properties
     #+cindex:attributes
     #+cindex:properties
     #+cindex:styles
   - Handling element attributes, properties, and styles is the focus of
     [[*Cutting Through Attributes-Properties-and CSS][chapter 12]].  While the differences in how the various browsers handle these
     aspects of elements are slowly converging over time, there still exists a
     number of knotty problems that this chapter describes how to solve.

     #+cindex:event handling
     #+cindex:custom events
     #+cindex:event delegation
   - Part 3 concludes in [[*Surviving Events][chapter 13]] with a thorough investigation of event
     handling in the browsers and ways to create a unified subsystem that
     handles events in a browser-agnostic manner.  This includes adding features
     not provided by the browsers, such as custom events and event delegation.

   #+cindex:advanced topics
   #+cindex:jQuery library
4. [[*Part 4---Master Training][Part 4]] wraps up the book with a look at advanced topics focusing on lessons
   learned from the creation of advanced JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery.

   #+cindex:DOM manipulation APIs
   #+cindex:Document Object Model
   #+cindex:manipulate DOM at runtime
   #+cindex:injecting elements into the DOM
   - In part 4 we pick up the pace and delve deeply into advanced topics taken
     from the heart of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.  [[*Manipulating the DOM][Chapter 14]]
     discusses how DOM manipulation APIs can be constructed to manipulate the
     Document Object Model at runtime, including the Gordian knot of injecting
     new elements into the DOM.

     #+cindex:CSS selector engines
   - Finally, in [[*CSS Selector Engines][chapter 15]], we discuss how CSS selector engines are
     constructed and the different ways in which they parse and evaluate
     selectors.  Not for the faint of heart, this chapter, but it’s a worthy
     final test of your ninja-hood.

**** Code Downloads
#+cindex:source code
#+cindex:download source code
Source code for all the working examples in this book (along with some extras
that never made it into the text) is available for [[https://www.manning.com/SecretsoftheJavaScriptNinja][download from the book’s web
page]].

#+cindex:Apache server
The code examples for this book are organized by chapter, with separate folders
for each chapter.  The layout is ready to be served by a local web server, such
as the Apache HTTP Server.  Simply unzip the downloaded code into a folder of
your choice and make that folder the document root of the application.  Most of
the examples don’t require the presence of a web server at all and can be
loaded directly into a browser for execution.

** Part 1---Preparing for Training
This part of the book will set the stage for your JavaScript ninja training.

In [[*Enter the Ninja][chapter 1]], you’ll learn what we’re trying to accomplish with this book, and
we’ll lay the framework for the environment in which JavaScript authors
operate.

[[*Arming with Testing and Debugging][Chapter 2]] will teach you why testing is so important and give you a brief
survey of some of the testing tools available. Then we’ll develop some
surprisingly simple testing tools that you’ll use throughout the rest of your
training.

- Cross-browser authoring

- Test suite examples


{{{heading(The Purpose of this Book)}}}

``This book sets out to uncover the techniques and secrets used by
... world-class code bases and to gather them into a single resource.  In this
book we’ll be examining the techniques that were (and continue to be) used to
create the popular JavaScript libraries.  The techniques and practices used to
create modern JavaScript libraries will be the focus of our attention in this
book.  Understanding how the very best JavaScript libraries are constructed can
provide us with great insight into how our own code can be constructed to
achieve these same goals.''

{{{heading(Creating Cross-Browser JavaScript Code)}}}

#+cindex:cross-browser JavaScript code
#+cindex:libraries, JavaScript
There’s nothing simple about creating effective and cross-browser JavaScript
code.

{{{subheading(Obtuse browser differences)}}}

In addition to the normal challenges of writing clean code, we have the
added complexity of dealing with obtuse browser differences and complexities.

{{{subheading(JavaScript Libraries)}}}

To deal with these challenges, JavaScript developers frequently /capture sets
of common and reusable functionality/ in the form of JavaScript libraries.

- common and reusable functionality

- JavaScript Libraries---sets of common and reusable functionality

- they need to be easy to use,

- incur the least amount of overhead, and

- be able to work across all browsers that we wish to target.


Understanding how the very best JavaScript libraries are constructed can
provide us with great insight into how our own code can be constructed to
achieve these same goals.

#+cindex:techniques, examine
/This book sets out to uncover the techniques and secrets used by these
world-class code bases and to gather them into a single resource/.  In this
book we’ll be examining the techniques that were (and continue to be) used to
create the popular JavaScript libraries.

**** The JavaScript libraries we’ll be tapping
The techniques and practices used to create modern JavaScript libraries will be
the focus of our attention in this book.

{{{heading(jQuery---The Primary Library)}}}

#+cindex:jQuery
The primary library that we’ll be considering is *jQuery*, which has risen in
prominence to be the most ubiquitous JavaScript library in modern use.

[[http://jquery.com][jQuery]] was created by John Resig and released in January of 2006.  /jQuery
popularized the use of CSS selectors to match DOM content/.  Among its many
capabilities, it provides

{{{subheading(jQuery Capabilities:)}}}

- DOM manipulation,
- Ajax,
- event handling, and
- animation functionality.


{{{heading(Prototype---Yahoo UI---base2)}}}

In addition to examining example code from jQuery, we’ll also look at
techniques utilized by the following libraries:

#+cindex:Prototype
- [[http://prototypejs.org/][Prototype]] :: The godfather of the modern JavaScript libraries, created by Sam
     Stephenson and released in 2005.  This library embodies DOM, Ajax, and
     event functionality, in addition to object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and
     functional programming techniques.

  #+cindex:Yahoo! UI
- [[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui][Yahoo! UI]] :: The result of internal JavaScript framework development at
     Yahoo! and released to the public in February of 2006.  Yahoo! UI (YUI)
     includes DOM, Ajax, event, and animation capabilities in addition to a
     number of preconstructed widgets (calendar, grid, accordion, and others).

  #+cindex:base2
  #+cindex:Edwards, Dean
- [[http://code.google.com/p/base2][base2]] :: Created by Dean Edwards and released in March 2007.  This library
     supports DOM and event functionality.  Its claim to fame is that it
     attempts to implement the various W3C specifications in a universal,
     cross-browser manner.


These techniques aren’t only useful for constructing large libraries; they can
be applied to all JavaScript coding, regardless of size.

{{{heading(How JavaScript Libraries are Analyzed)}}}

#+cindex:JavaScript library, makeup
The makeup of a JavaScript library can be broken down into three aspects:

- Advanced use of the JavaScript language

- Meticulous construction of cross-browser code

- The use of current best practices that tie everything together


We’ll be carefully analyzing these three aspects in each of the libraries to
gather a complete knowledge base we can use to create our own effective
JavaScript code.

**** Understanding the JavaScript language

{{{heading(Objects---Functions---Closures)}}}

JavaScript consists of a close relationship between:
- objects,
- functions, and
- closures

#+caption:JavaScript consists of a close relationship between objects, functions, and closures.
#+name:fig-JS-objects-functions-closures
[[https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/resig/Figures/01fig01.jpg]]

Understanding the strong relationship between these three concepts can vastly
improve our JavaScript programming ability, giving us a strong foundation for
any type of application development.

{{{heading(Timers---Regular Expressions)}}}

#+cindex:timers
#+cindex:regular expressions
In addition to these fundamental concepts, there are two features in JavaScript
that are woefully underused:

- timers; and

- regular expressions.


These two concepts have applications in virtually any JavaScript code base, but
they aren’t always used to their full potential due to their misunderstood
nature.  A firm grasp of how /timers/ operate within the browser, all too
frequently a mystery, gives us the ability to tackle complex coding tasks such
as long-running computations and smooth animations.  And a sound understanding
of how /regular expressions/ work allows us to simplify what would otherwise be
quite complicated pieces of code.

{{{heading(The ~with~ Statement---The ~eval()~ Method)}}}

#+cindex:@code{with} statement
#+cindex:@code{eval()} method
As another high point of our advanced tour of the JavaScript language, we’ll
take a look at the ~with~ statement in chapter 10, and the divisive ~eval()~
method in chapter 9---two important, but controversial, language features that
have been trivialized, misused, and even condemned outright by many JavaScript
programmers.

**** Cross-Browser Considerations
When developing browser-based JavaScript applications (which is the focus of
this book), sooner rather than later, we’re going to run face first into The
Browsers and their maddening issues and inconsistencies.

The quality of browsers has improved greatly as of late, but they all still
have some bugs, missing APIs, and browser-specific quirks that we’ll need top
deal with.  Developing a comprehensive strategy for tackling these browser
issues, and becoming intimately familiar with their differences and quirks, is
just as important, if not more so, than proficiency in JavaScript itself.

When writing browser applications or JavaScript libraries to be used in them,
picking and choosing which browsers to support is an important consideration.
We’d probably like to support them all, but limitations on development and
testing resources dictate otherwise.  So how do we decide which to support, and
to what level?

...

**** Current best practices
#+cindex:best practices
To enter the big leagues, you also need to exhibit the traits that scores of
previous developers have proved are beneficial to the development of quality
code.  These traits, which we’ll examine in depth in chapter 2, are known as
/best practices/ and, in addition to mastery of the language, include such
elements as:

#+cindex:testing
- Testing

  #+cindex:performance analysis
- Performance analysis

  #+cindex:debugging skills
- Debugging skills

***** Current best practice---testing
#+cindex:@code{assert(_} function
#+cindex:testing tool
We’ll be applying a number of testing techniques that serve to ensure that our
example code operates as intended, as well as to serve as examples of how to
test general code.  The primary tool that we’ll be using for testing is an
~assert()~ function, whose purpose is to assert that a premise is either =true=
or =false=.

The general form of this function is:
: assert(condition, message);
where the first parameter is a condition that should be true, and the second is
a message that will be displayed if it’s not.

Note that the ~assert()~ function isn’t an innate feature of the language (some
languages, such as Java, provide such capabilities), so we’ll be implementing
it ourselves.  We’ll be discussing its implementation and use in chapter 2.

***** Current best practice---performance analysis
#+cindex:performance analysis
We’ll be using code such as the following later in this book for collecting
performance information:

#+begin_src js
start = new Date().getTime();
for (var n = 0; n < maxCount; n++) {
  /* perform the operation to be measured *//
}
elapsed = new Date().getTime() - start;
assert(true,"Measured time: " + elapsed);
#+end_src

#+cindex:timestamps, performance analysis
Here, we bracket the execution of the code to be measured with the collection
of timestamps: one before we execute the code and one after.  Their difference
tells us how long the code took to perform, which we can compare against
alternatives to the code that we measure using the same technique.

Note how we perform the code multiple times; in this example, we perform it the
number of times represented by maxCount.  Because a single operation of the
code happens much too quickly to measure reliably, we need to perform the code
many times to get a measurable value.  Frequently, this count can be in the
tens of thousands, or even millions, depending upon the nature of the code
being measured.  A little trial and-error lets us choose a reasonable value.

*** Arming with Testing and Debugging
:PROPERTIES:
:chapter:  2
:END:

Coverage:
- Tools for debugging JavaScript code
- Techniques for generating tests
- Building a test suite
- How to test asynchronous operations


#+cindex:test suites
Constructing effective test suites for your code is always important, so we’re
going to discuss it now, before we go into any discussions on coding.  As
important as a solid testing strategy is for all code, it can be crucial for
situations where /external factors/ have the potential to affect the operation
of your code, which is exactly the case we’re faced with in cross-browser
JavaScript development.  We also have the problem of determining if our code
works in all the browsers that we choose to support.  It’s vital that the
importance of testing be emphasized and testing strategies defined, because
we’ll be using these strategies throughout the rest of the book.

In this chapter, we’re going to look at:

#+cindex:debugging JavaScript
- some tools and techniques for debugging JavaScript code,
- for generating tests based upon those results, and
- for constructing a test suite to reliably run those tests.

**** Debugging code
#+cindex:debuggin
Similar tools have been developed for all major browsers:

#+cindex:Firebug
- [[http://getfirebug.org/][Firebug]]
  #+cindex:IE Developer
- IE Developer Tools—Included in Internet Explorer 8 and later.
  #+cindex:Opera Dragonfly
- Opera Dragonfly
  #+cindex:WebKit Developer Tools
- WebKit Developer Tools---Introduced in Safari 3, dramatically improved as of
  Safari 4, and now available in Chrome.


There are two important approaches to debugging JavaScript:
#+cindex:logging
- logging and
  #+cindex:breakpoints
- breakpoints.

***** Logging
#+cindex:logging
#+cindex:@code{console.log()}
Logging statements (such as using the ~console.log()~ method in Firebug,
Safari, Chrome, IE, and recent versions of Opera) are part of the code (even if
perhaps temporarily) and are useful in a cross-browser sense.  We can write
logging calls in our code, and we can benefit from seeing the messages in the
consoles of all modern browsers.

All our logging statements can be written to the console and be browsed
immediately or at a later time without impeding the normal flow of the program.
For example, if we wanted to know what the value of a variable named ~x~ was at
a certain point in the code, we might write this:

#+begin_src js
var x = 213;
console.log(x);
#+end_src

***** Breakpoints
#+cindex:breakpoints
Breakpoints are a somewhat more complex concept than logging, but they possess
a notable advantage over logging: they halt the execution of a script at a
specific line of code, pausing the browser.  This allows us to leisurely
investigate the state of all sorts of things at the point of the break.  This
includes all accessible variables, the context, and the scope chain.

#+name:setting-breakpoints
#+begin_src html :tangle public/breakpoint.html :mkdirp yes
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Listing 2.2</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="log.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">var x = 213;
      log(x); <!-- Set a breakpoint here -->
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

#+cindex:breakpoint, set
If we were to set a breakpoint using Firebug on the annotated line B in listing
2.2 (by clicking on the line number margin in the Script display) and refresh
the page to cause the code to execute, the debugger would stop execution at
that line and show us the display in figure 2.2.

Note how the rightmost pane allows us to see the state within which our code is
running, including the value of ~x~.  The debugger breaks on a line before the
breakpointed line is actually executed; in this example, the call to the
~log()~ method has yet to be executed.

#+cindex:step into
If we were trying to debug a problem with our new method, we might want to step
into that method to see what’s going on inside it.  Clicking on the “step into”
button (the left-most gold arrow button) causes the debugger to execute up to
the first line of our method, and we’d see the display shown in figure 2.3.
Note how the displayed state has changed.

Debugging code not only serves its primary and obvious purpose (detecting and
fixing bugs), but it also can help us achieve the current best-practice goal of
generating effective test cases.

**** Test generation
Good tests exhibit three important characteristics:

- Repeatability ::

                   Our test results should be highly reproducible.  Tests run
                   repeatedly should always produce the exact same results.  If
                   test results are nondeterministic, how would we know which
                   results are valid and which are invalid?  Additionally,
                   reproducibility ensures that our tests aren’t dependent upon
                   external factors issues like network or CPU loads.

- Simplicity ::

                Our tests should focus on testing one thing.  We should strive
                to remove as much HTML markup, CSS, or JavaScript as we can
                without disrupting the intent of the test case.  The more we
                remove, the greater the likelihood that the test case will only
                be influenced by the specific code that we’re testing.

- Independence ::

                  Our tests should execute in isolation.  We must avoid making
                  the results from one test dependent upon another.  Breaking
                  tests down into the smallest possible units will help us
                  determine the exact source of a bug when an error occurs.


There are a number of approaches that can be used for constructing tests, with
the two primary approaches being:

- deconstructive tests
- constructive tests

* Speaking JavaScript---An In-Depth Guide for Programmers
- http://speakingjs.com/

- By Dr. Axel Rauschmayer

- This book covers JavaScript up to and including ECMAScript 5.
** About Speaking JavaScript
This book has been written for programmers, by a programmer.  In order to
understand it, you should already know object-oriented programming, for
example, via a mainstream programming language such as Java, PHP, C++, Python,
Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, C#, or Perl.

Thus, the book’s target audience is programmers who want to learn JavaScript
quickly and properly, and JavaScript programmers who want to deepen their
skills and/or look up specific topics.

Speaking JavaScript has four parts:

1. JavaScript Quick Start: Learn a safe subset of JavaScript in less than 30
   pages.
2. Background: When, why, and how was JavaScript created? How is it related to
   other programming languages? What were the important steps that got us to
   where we are today?
3. JavaScript in Depth: This part is more of a reference: look for a topic that
   you are interested in, jump in, and explore. I still tried to make it fun to
   read.
4. Tips, Tools, and Libraries: This part gives tips for using JavaScript: best
   practices, advanced techniques, and learning resources. It also describes a
   few important tools and libraries.

* Setting Up ES6
- https://exploringjs.com/setting-up-es6.html

- By Dr. Axel Rauschmayer
** About Setting Up ES6
ES6 (whose official name is ECMAScript 2015) is the latest version of
JavaScript.  This book explains how to set up ES6 projects that are compiled to
ES5 via Babel 6.  It covers the following scenarios:

- Deploying ES6 in browsers via Babel and webpack
- Deploying ES6 in Node.js, by statically or dynamically compiling it via
  Babel.

- By Dr. Axel Rauschmayer

** About JavaScript for Impatient Programmers
This book makes JavaScript less challenging to learn for newcomers, by offering
a modern view that is as consistent as possible.

{{{heading(Highlights)}}}

- Get started quickly, by initially focusing on modern features.
- Test-driven exercises and quizzes available for most chapters.
- Covers all essential features of JavaScript, up to and including ES2019.
- Optional advanced sections let you dig deeper.

* Exploring ReasonML and Functional Programming
- http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/

- By Dr. Axel Rauschmayer

** About Exploring Reason ML
- ReasonML: This book teaches the programming language ReasonML by Facebook.
- Functional programming: It is also an introduction to functional
  programming. Especially people familiar with C-style languages (Java,
  JavaScript, C#, etc.) will profit from ReasonML’s familiar syntax.
- Required knowledge: You should know how to program, e.g. in a mainstream
  language such as Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Go, etc.

[fn:9] Now Stage 3 

[fn:8] Now Stage 4 

[fn:7] Note that we save this method as ~Function.prototype.bind~, so that all
function objects inherit it. 

[fn:6] The ECMAScript 5 spec says that ~undefined~ is (almost) always passed,
but that the function being called should change its ~thisValue~ to the global
object when /not/ in strict mode.  This allows strict mode callers to avoid
breaking existing non-strict-mode libraries. 

[fn:5] Roughly 2000--2010

[fn:1] Except "use strict"

[fn:2] Except leading zeroes in parseInt

[fn:3] Partially supported by all browsers
